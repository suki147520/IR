       " 'e': 'Purpose: To evaluate the dosimetric differences between coplanar and noncoplanar volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plans for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombosis. Materials and Method: Both coplanar and noncoplanar VMAT plans of seven patients with HCC and PVT were designed with a prescribed dose 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The plan quality indexes, such as dose conformity and dose homogeneity, would be calculate in the same dose coverage of 100% prescribed dose covered 95% PTV. The doses of spinal cord, kidney, small bowel and normal liver (whole liver minus CTV) would be collect and analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results : The average conformity of coplanar and noncoplanar VMAT plans were 0.809 ± 0.059 and 0.847 ± 0.043, and the average homogeneity were 1.041 ± 0.007 and 1.047 ± 0.008. There were no significant difference in both conformity and homogeneity between two plan sets. The maximal dose in spinal cord and small bowel, and mean dose in left side kidney, and V_5, V_(10), V_(20), V_(30), V_(40), V_(50) of normal liver in noncoplanar VMAT plans were slightly lower than that in coplanar plans, but without significant difference. The mean dose of normal liver were significantly decreased from 17.15 ± 5.00 Gy in coplanar VMAT plans to 16.01 ± 4.93 Gy in noncoplanar VMAT plans. (p= 0.018) The mean dose of right side kidney were significantly decreased from 4.89 ± 3.07 Gy in coplanar VMAT plans to 3.55 ± 2.30 Gy in noncoplanar VMAT plans (p= 0.018), and V_(18) of right side kidney were significantly decreased from 3.57 ± 5.88% in coplanar VMAT plans to 0.93 ± 2.44% in noncoplanar VMAT plans (p= 0.043). Conclusions: The noncoplanar VMAT plans used in treatments of HCC patients with PVT may decrease mean dose of normal liver and mean dose and V_(18) of right side kidney in similar PTV dose coverage, homogeneity and conformity.',\n",

Materials and Method: Both coplanar and noncoplanar VMAT plans of seven patients with HCC and PVT were designed with a prescribed dose 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The plan quality indexes, such as dose conformity and dose homogeneity, would be calculate in the same dose coverage of 100% prescribed dose covered 95% PTV. The doses of spinal cord, kidney, small bowel and normal liver (whole liver minus CTV) would be collect and analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results : The average conformity of coplanar and noncoplanar VMAT plans were 0.809 ± 0.059 and 0.847 ± 0.043, and the average homogeneity were 1.041 ± 0.007 and 1.047 ± 0.008. There were no significant difference in both conformity and homogeneity between two plan sets. The maximal dose in spinal cord and small bowel, and mean dose in left side kidney, and V_5, V_(10), V_(20), V_(30), V_(40), V_(50) of normal liver in noncoplanar VMAT plans were slightly lower than that in coplanar plans, but without significant difference. The mean dose of normal liver were significantly decreased from 17.15 ± 5.00 Gy in coplanar VMAT plans to 16.01 ± 4.93 Gy in noncoplanar VMAT plans. (p= 0.018) The mean dose of right side kidney were significantly decreased from 4.89 ± 3.07 Gy in coplanar VMAT plans to 3.55 ± 2.30 Gy in noncoplanar VMAT plans (p= 0.018), and V_(18) of right side kidney were significantly decreased from 3.57 ± 5.88% in coplanar VMAT plans to 0.93 ± 2.44% in noncoplanar VMAT plans (p= 0.043). Conclusions: The noncoplanar VMAT plans used in treatments of HCC patients with PVT may decrease mean dose of normal liver and mean dose and V_(18) of right side kidney in similar PTV dose coverage, homogeneity and conformity.',\n",

      "Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and toxicity of induction bio-chemotherapy followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients with previously untreated, stage III/IV NPC received induction bio-chemotherapy followed by IMRT. Induction chemotherapy consists of weekly P-FL (cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) doublet (n= 17) or a triplet of P-FL-G (P-FL + gemcitabine, n= 7) or P-FL-D (P-FL + docetaxel, n= 1) for a total of 10-12 weeks. Cetuximab 400 mg/m^2 day 1, then 250 mg/m^2 were administered every week. IMRT 70 Gy/35 fractions were delivered to T1-3 lesions and 74 Gy/37 fractions or 76.8 Gy/64 fractions to the T4 tumor. Results: Baseline characteristics are median age= 44 year-old; male/female= 19/6; performance status ECOG 0/1= 13/12; stage III/IV= 12/13, and pathological type (WHO) IIa/IIb= 12/13. All patients tolerated induction bio-chemotherapy very well. Grade 3 toxicity included leucopenia (8.0%) and skin rashes (40.0%). There was no grade 4 toxicity. After induction bio-chemotherapy, we obtained 52.0% complete response rate and 48.0% partial response rate. Thirteen of 24 (54.2%) patients who received re-biopsy of the nasopharynx before IMRT were reported as no viable tumor. IMRT was performed smoothly with a median treatment time of 49 days (range 45-53). After a median follow-up of 21 months, we observed 4 treatment failures, all in distant sites. The 2-year rates overall survival, locoregional failure-free and distant failure-free survivals were 100%, 100%, and 80%, respectively. Conclusion: Induction chemotherapy plus concurrent weekly cetuximab followed by IMRT is a highly effective protocol with very low toxicity in advanced NPC.\n",

       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of homemade immobilization equipment of right decubitus position for left breast cancer treatment by comparing the heart and lung doses of right decubitus position with those of supine position. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one early-stage left breast cancer patients of Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center (KFSYSCC) were collected in this study. Based on the location of the tumor bed, 8 Upper Inner Quadrant (UIQ), 5 Upper Outer Quadrant (UOQ), 4 Central, 2 Lower Inner Quadrant (LIQ) and 2 Lower Outer Quadrant (LOQ) sites were classified. Two sets of CT images (right decubitus and supine position) were acquired. Homemade alpha-cradle with 20 degrees tilt and homemade immobilization device of legs were used for the right decubitus position while the routine treatment position with both arms raised and head turned to the opposite side of treatment side was set for the supine position. Heart dose (V_5, V_(10), V_(25) and mean dose) and lung dose (V_5, V_(10), V_(20) and mean dose) of right decubitus position were compared with those of supine position by using parameters of breast volume, Maximum Heart Distance (MHD), Maximum Heart Length (MHL) and Central Lung Distance (CLD) in the same condition of Planning Target Volume (PTV) coverage. Results: There was no correlation between breast volume and heart dose. Heart dose could be decreased by using right decubitus position because of decreased MHD and MHL. Under this condition, the maximum decreased mean heart dose, V_5, V_(10) and V_(25) were 48.2% ± 14.0%, 7.6% ± 6.0%, 4.2% ± 2.4% and 1.9% ± 1.3%, respectively. CLD was not always decreased in the right decubitus position compared to the supine position. Therefore, lung dose was not always decreased by using the right decubitus position. Heart dose was decreased effectively for tumor in the LIQ. Heart dose for tumor in the UIQ or UOQ was lower than that in other position. For tumor in the Central position, lung dose was a little bit increased by using the right decubitus position. The mean dose of lung was increased 16.4 cGy and the Dose-Volume value was increased within 1%. Conclusion: Heart dose can be decreased effectively by using right decubitus position. Homemade immobilization equipment for right decubitus position is now routinely used for early-stage left breast cancer treatment at KFSYSCC.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the dosimetric differences between coplanar and noncoplanar volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plans for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombosis. Materials and Method: Both coplanar and noncoplanar VMAT plans of seven patients with HCC and PVT were designed with a prescribed dose 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The plan quality indexes, such as dose conformity and dose homogeneity, would be calculate in the same dose coverage of 100% prescribed dose covered 95% PTV. The doses of spinal cord, kidney, small bowel and normal liver (whole liver minus CTV) would be collect and analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results : The average conformity of coplanar and noncoplanar VMAT plans were 0.809 ± 0.059 and 0.847 ± 0.043, and the average homogeneity were 1.041 ± 0.007 and 1.047 ± 0.008. There were no significant difference in both conformity and homogeneity between two plan sets. The maximal dose in spinal cord and small bowel, and mean dose in left side kidney, and V_5, V_(10), V_(20), V_(30), V_(40), V_(50) of normal liver in noncoplanar VMAT plans were slightly lower than that in coplanar plans, but without significant difference. The mean dose of normal liver were significantly decreased from 17.15 ± 5.00 Gy in coplanar VMAT plans to 16.01 ± 4.93 Gy in noncoplanar VMAT plans. (p= 0.018) The mean dose of right side kidney were significantly decreased from 4.89 ± 3.07 Gy in coplanar VMAT plans to 3.55 ± 2.30 Gy in noncoplanar VMAT plans (p= 0.018), and V_(18) of right side kidney were significantly decreased from 3.57 ± 5.88% in coplanar VMAT plans to 0.93 ± 2.44% in noncoplanar VMAT plans (p= 0.043). Conclusions: The noncoplanar VMAT plans used in treatments of HCC patients with PVT may decrease mean dose of normal liver and mean dose and V_(18) of right side kidney in similar PTV dose coverage, homogeneity and conformity.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To compare the secondary cancer risk (SCR) in cranio-spinal irradiation for three radiotherapy-planning techniques, namely, three dimension conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). The SCRmodel was established by usingthe organ equivalent dose (OED) to calculate the value of extra absolute risk (EAR). Materials & Methods: In total five patients were included who underwent cranio-spinal irradiation between March 2010 and February 2016 in our hospital. Three different treatment plans were created including 3D-CRT, IMRT and VMAT. The dose-volume histogram (DVH) obtained was used to calculate OED and SCR. Three SCR models established can be utilized to evaluate secondary cancer risks after cranio-spinal irradiation. Results: The highest EAR value in small intestine was greater than 50 for 3D-CRT; as well as in lung was greater than 30 (per 10,000/per year) for VMAT. However, the EAR values in liver and oral cavity were less than 10 (per 10,000/per year) for the three techniques. Conclusion: This is the first study to establish the EAR parameters and evaluation of SCRs by three radiotherapy-planning techniques in cranio-spinal irradiation in Taiwan. The result can be used as a clinical reference for evaluating secondary malignancy risks after radiation therapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Cancer patients with intracranial metastasis were traditionally treated with bilateral-field (BF) technique for whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Planning BF is simple and saves both treatment and planning time. However, the relatively crude method suffers from lack of dose conformity and homogeneity. These two factors may increase the complications of normal tissue and hair loss. However, with current improved techniques, the rapid development of therapeutic planning systems and the development of new treatment technologies such as volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and field-in-field (FIF) techniques, the treatment quality of whole brain irradiation should be reconsidered. Materials and Methods: The contours of whole brain PTV and the critical organs of ten patients were determined by one radiation oncologist and checked by another one. Bilateral- fields whole brain treatment plans were created. At the same time, a pair of sub-fields from the BF plans were modified to MLCs to create FIF plans. All BF, FIF and VMAT plans for each patient had a prescribed dose of 30 Gy in 12 fractions. The global maximum dose, dose comformity, and dose homogeneity were calculated to the same level as the tumor coverage. All organ doses were normalized to a single biological equivalent dose of 2 Gy fractions. All data was analyzed with non-parametric statistics. Results: The average maximal doses (normalized to the prescribed dose) of BF, FIF and VMAT plans were 113.28% ± 1.62% (mean ± std), 108.33% ± 1.16% and 110.53% ± 0.25%. The mean conformity of BF, FIF and VMAT plans were 0.633 ± 0.033, 0.664 ± 0.023 and 0.853 ± 0.011. The mean homogeneity of BF, FIF and VMAT plans were 0.552 ± 0.166, 0.841 ± 0.150 and 0.284 ± 0.086. The VMAT regimen had a better dose conformity and therefore significantly reduced organ damage at the critical organs, such as spinal cord, optic nerve, parotid glands, cochleae, and posterior scalp. However, poor dose homogeneity also compromised organ dose endpoints (such as the brainstem, hippocampus and optic chiasm) with slightly elevated doses. Conclusions: The FIF treatment plan has the lowest percentage of maximum dose and the best dose homogeneity, so the FIF treatment plan could completely replace the BF treatment plan to improve the quality of whole-brain irradiation treatment. The better dose conformity for the VMAT treatment plan reduces organ complications outside the target area with somewhat worse homogeneity. Both FIF or VMAT can be used as a treatment option to improve the quality of life of patients with brain metastases.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To Investigate the coplanar and non-coplanar treatment plan in hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiotherapy. Materials and Methods: In this study, we enrolled nine indicated patients with brain metastasis to receive hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiotherapy in regional hospital in Southern Taiwan from 2016 to 2017. We conducted to compare two different treatment plans using the technique of volumetric modulated arc therapy. All patients were fixed with head mask and set up a head flexion angle of 30°, and then received computed tomography simulation. We analyzed the coplanar and non-coplanar treatment plan using therapy planning system (Philip Pinnacle Planning System Version 9.2). Dose constraints were set equally to compare homogeneity index and conformity index of the planning target volume (PTV), and organs at risk (OAR), including the hippocampus, eyes, lens, and optic nerves. Results: The results show two treatment plan all conform the dose-limited guideline of Radiotherapy Therapy Oncology Group 0933. The homogeneity and conformal index of two treatment plans, non-coplanar plan is better than coplanar plan (p＜0.05). The dose distribution of D_(2%), D_(98%), and D_(mean) of PTV between bilateral hippocampus, non-coplanar plan is more homogenous than coplanar counterpart and achieve statistical significance (p＜ 0.05). The dose of two plans in both hippocampus and hippocampus avoidance region is similar (p＞ 0.05). Other OAR in both two plans was also similar (p＞ 0.05). However, treatment time of the coplanar plan can be significantly shorter than the non-coplanar plan (p＜ 0.05). Conclusions: Our study concluded the non-coplanar plan is better than the coplanar plan. However, longer therapy time is needed in non-coplanar plan. Whether the longer therapy time might lead to patient's discomfort, then result to internal shift and set-up error. Ongoing study need to be further explored clinically.\",\n",
       " 'Objective: We investigate treatment-related factors to affect setup errors during the course in radiotherapy using helical TomoTherapy® and recommend required safety margins for planning target volume (PTV) clinically. Materials and Methods: The literature indicates that may affect setup errors including systematic error (Σ) and random error (σ). The factors to impact σ in radiotherapy may be caused by age of patient, gender, tumor site, body mass index (BMI), weight loss, cancer stage, and the status whether metastasis. In the study, we collected a total of 138 patients who received helical TomoTherapy® from 2013 to 2016 at a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. All patients received megavoltage computed tomography for daily therapy position checkup. A total of 4081 sets of images were collected for analysis of setup error. We calculate means, standard deviations of daily setup error of each patient in three axis directions (X, Y, Z-axis), three dimensional (3D) vector, and Y-axis (roll) rotation during the treatment. Then Σ and σ are derived from adopted equations in the literature. In the study we analyzed which to factors to influence setup error during treatment. The formula (2.5Σ+0.7σ) by the author van Herk et al. is proposed to recommend safety margin of PTV clinically. Results: The factors significantly affect daily setup error in X, Y, Z-axis, 3D vector, and Y-axis (roll) rotation were in groups of patient’s age (p= 0.05), tumor sites (p＜ 0.001), and BMI (p＜ 0.001). Single regression analysis in factors to affect 3D vector setup error, we found tumor sites, weight loss, and tumor stage to achieve statistical significance. Another single regression analysis in factors to affect Y-axis (roll) rotation setup error, we disclosed only tumor site to achieve statistical significance. After multiple regression model, we concluded tumor site is the only factor to influence setup error significantly (p＜ 0.001). In the study, we recommended wider safety margins of PTV are 5-11 mm in X, Y, Z- axes in chest, abdomen, pelvis, and prostate tumors. The safety margins are 5-8 mm and 5-6 mm in the age group of 70-89 and the BMI ≥25 respectively. Conclusion: The important factors to affect setup error are age of patient, tumor site, and BMI. In this study, we recommend the safety margin in PTV should be individualized based on these setup error factors in the clinical practice of helical TomoTherapy®.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is widely used as therapy for localized lung cancer or metastases. Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) is the most common technique used to estimate the internal motion of lung cancer tumors. The purpose of this study was to observe tumor motion with 4DCT image in SBRT patients. Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis. From September 2008 to March 2016; forty patients with proven pathology for lung cancer or pulmonary metastasis, treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy were included in this study. All patients underwent three dimensional (3D) and four dimensional (4D) CT scans. GTV_(3D) and GTV_(4D) were created from 3D and 4DCT scanning, respectively. The volume, position and other tumor parameters, included matching index (MI) and degree of inclusion (DI) between GTV_(3D) and GTV_(4D) were also compared in this study. Results: The tumor motion measured by comparison of different 4DCT phases was highest for the CC direction (mean 0.65 cm, median 0.40 cm, range 0.10 - 2.70 cm). The next highest was for the AP direction (mean 0.24 cm, median 0.20 mm, range 0 - 0.90 cm) then the LR direction (mean 0.15 cm, median 0.10 cm, range 0 - 0.40 cm). The mean motion vector was 0.44 ± 0.21 cm, 0.73 ± 0.45 cm and 1.35 ± 0.81 cm in upper, middle and lower lobes, respectively. This shows that tumors located in the lower lobe of the lung exhibited the greatest amount of motion, and the magnitude was usually greatest along the CC axis. The MI and DI in the lower lobe was significantly different from the upper and middle lobes (p ＜ 0.05). No clinical or anatomic factors were identified as being related to the magnitude of the tumor excursion, except for lobe location (p= 0.005). Conclusion: Respiration induced tumor motion is an important issue in high precision SBRT. Using 4DCT information can greatly improve the target definition for lung cancer. The respiratory management technique is necessary for middle and lower lung lobes tumors in our study according to The AAPM Task Group 76 report [11]. The tumor motion in all patients was anisotropic, the amplitude was significantly larger in the CC direction than in AP and LR directions. To avoid the target missing and reduce the normal tissue irradiated. The anisotropic margins of ITV were more appropriate than isotropic margin in lung tumor. The tumor movement in lower lobe tumors is obviously greater than in the upper and middle lobes, especially where tumors are adhered to the chest wall and diaphragm. The greater margin in the CC direction especially for lower lobe tumors should be added. To account the internal motions which arise from breathing, the 4DCT is necessary for lung tumor especially in SBRT patients.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: Based on recently published studies, surgical resection of pulmonary metastatic nodules may improve the prognosis for sarcoma patients. Here, we try to report the safety and efficacy of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) as a local treatment for pulmonary metastatic sarcoma. Case report: The present report demonstrated sarcoma patients who were treated for pulmonary metastatic lesions using the CyberKnife® radiosurgery system. There were a total of three patients with seven lesions. In the first 3 months post SABR, one lesion was complete response, another was partial response, 4 lesions was stable disease and only 1 lesion was progressive disease. Overall survival for each patient was 11, 19 and 35 months from lung metastasis diagnosis, respectively. No high grade toxicity was observed at the time of analysis. Discussion: The present report demonstrated that SABR may be an acceptable alternative option for pulmonary metastatic sarcoma in patients in whom surgery is contraindicated. However, more patients are required for statistical analysis.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the pretreatment lymphocyte count (preT LC) and clinical outcomes in patients with head-and-neck cancer treated with chemoradiation (CRT) or radiotherapy (RT) Materials and Methods: All 610 patients with newly diagnosed head-and-neck cancer who were treated by CCRT or RT were retrospectively reviewed. The median follow-up duration was 5.13 years. Overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (LFS), regional recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were analyzed by preT LC, with a cutoff of 1885 cells/μL. (＜ 1,885 cells/μL vs. ≥ 1,885 cells/μL) Results: The preT median lymphocyte count was 1,885 cells/μL (range: 285-5341). Patients in higher preT LC group was characterized by higher BMI (p = 0.023), more smoker (p ＜ 0.001), and more drinker (p = 0.043). On multivariate analysis, patients with higher preT LC were statistically significantly associated with better OS and DMFS than those with lower preT LC. There was no significant difference between preT LC groups in terms of LFS and RFS. Conclusions: Our data demonstrates that higher preT LC was independently associated with better DMFS and OS for patients with head-and-neck cancer treated with CRT or RT',\n",
       " 'Introduction: Recent studies have revealed that nanoscale structure (nanotopography) of extracellular matrix is an important regulator of cell biology. However, it remains unknown whether nanotopography regulates cancer cell behaviors upon exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Materials and Methods: Hepatoma cell lines and a squamous cell carcinoma cell line were cultured on nanopatterned polycaprolactone surfaces and were irradiated. Sphere formation was counted and expression of cancer stemness-related genes (Sox2, Nanog and Oct3/4) was measured with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: In this study, we showed that IR induced expression of stemness genes including Sox2, Nanog and Oct3/4 in several cancer cell lines. Growing J5 hepatoma cells on a square lattice of evenly-spaced nanopits made of polycaprolactone attenuates cancer stemness genes expression induced by IR. Growing J5 cells on a near-square lattice of nanopits has smaller effects on IR-induced cancer stemness genes expression. The phenomenon was reproducible in another cell line derived from squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusions: We provided experimental evidence that radiation-induced expression of cancer stemness genes in cancer cells is regulated by nanotopography of the attaching surface. Further research is warranted to analyze molecular interaction between integrin signaling and cancer stemness, as well as the implications for cancer radiotherapy.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To replace paper medical records, we constructed an integrated Radiation Therapy Electronic Medical Record (RTEMR) system, and connected it to heterogeneous Radiation Oncology Information Systems (ROIS) from three independent vendors in our department - ARIA/VARiS, MOSAIQ and Tomotherapy - to acquire real-time treatment records. In addition, data exchange between RTEMR and Health Information System (HIS) allowed RTEMR to get patients' basic data and inpatient/outpatient status from HIS, and medical personnel in other departments can access the most updated information about radiotherapy progress, regardless of treatment unit. Materials and Methods: After analyzing the database structure of ROIS, and meeting with multidisciplinary staff in our department, RTEMR underwent development, as a successor of our original single-user standalone management software. The web-based interface of RTEMR has several advantages: installation-free, ease-of-update and cross-platform. The system provides the real-time treatment progress in terms of cumulative dose and fractions to plans' reference points or physician prescribed target volume. Results: RTEMR can display different functions according to user's login identity. Self-serve checkin system can help our staff to keep track of patients' current state. Patient lists for doctors and treatment machine can show check-in status, treatment status, and special notes. Other important applications of RTEMR are auto-generation of radiation therapy treatment summary and several routine reports for administrative purpose. Conclusion: RTEMR can increase the efficiency and decrease the risk of near miss in clinical work. Further integration with health information system and cancer information system will improve the quality of radiation therapy.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: While delivering radiation beam to a head and neck cancer patient, a thermoplastic mask is used to fix the position of head and neck region to ensure the reproducibility of head and neck posture during the whole treatment process. However, the location of the shoulders is not accurate according to comparison of image navigation in the clinical treatment. In this study, we hoped to improve the shoulder position reproducibility of patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer by using the plan-do-check-action (PDCA) of quality control circle (QCC). Material and Method: From February 2014 to December 2014 in TomoTherapy. Daily shoulder position variation relative to treatment isocenter was quantified using MVCT-based bony alignment for 184 images with head and neck patients. Shoulder position variation was evaluated with daily CT scans from an MVCT scan. From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, We use of quality control of the way, to improve the shoulder position reproducibility of patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer Results: The shoulder displacement less than 5 mm rate was 58.69% at the beginning. The rate of ＜ 5 mm shoulder displacement was 90% after intervention. The shoulder less than 10 mm displacement rate was 88.95%. The displacement was 100% ＜10 mm after intervention for improvement. It was found that the result of plan-do-check-action (PDCA) of quality control circle (QCC) could be maintained after keeping track of the shoulder displacement. Conclusion: The application of quality control circle can effectively identify problems, improve the problem, and solve the problem and the establish of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The shoulder retractor can be applied to different patients with hand-pull position, and can be quantified the shoulder position to achieve higher reproducibility of the head and neck cancer shoulder position.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the positioning reproducibility of α-cradle and vacuum bag for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma via cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Safe margins for planning target volume (PTV) were also measured. Methods and Materials: From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, CBCT data of 68 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were collected. For patient positioning, α-cradle was used until October 2014. Vacuum bag with abdominal compression was used since October 2014. Patients were imaged before treatment to ascertain inter-fraction motion. Overall mean (M), standard deviation of system error (Σ) and standard deviation of random error (σ) were used to compare the positioning reproducibility. Safe margins for PTV were derived from the equation: 2.5Σ+0.7σ. Results: There were 35 patients in α-cradle group and 33 patients in vacuum bag group. The overall means and standard deviations of the X, Y, and Z axes in α-cradle group and in vacuum bag group were 0.4 ± 1.8 mm and 0.3 ± 1.8 mm (p = 0.82), 0.6 ± 2.6 mm and 0.2 ±2.5 mm (p = 0.52), -0.6 ± 2.0 mm and 0 ± 1.5 mm (p = 0.15), respectively. The PTV safe margins in the X, Y, and Z axes of α-cradle group were 5.7 mm, 8.7 mm and 6.8 mm, respectively. The PTV safe margins in the X, Y, and Z axes of vacuum bag group were 6.1 mm, 9.3 mm and 5.4 mm, respectively. Conclusions: There was no significant difference of positioning reproducibility between α-cradle and vacuum bag. For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the PTV safe margins in the X, Y, and Z axes were 7 mm, 10 mm and 7 mm, respectively.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the effect of set-up errors in breast cancer patients receiving breast irradiation using Active Breathing Coordinator system (ABC system) with deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) or free breathing (FB). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively estimated set-up errors in ten breast cancer patients receiving breast irradiation using ABC system with DIBH (DIBH) or FB. Daily image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) would be practiced for getting images in DIBH during deep inspiratory using ABC system and FB. In comparison with initial images in soft tissue windows from computed tomography simulator (CT-simulator), we have 280 images in DIBH and FB, respectively. Results: There were 3 patients during DIBH and 7 patients during FB having significant set-up errors in the orientation of right to left (R/L). In the orientation of superior to inferior (S/I), there were 8 patients during DIBH and 2 patients during FB having significant set-up error. Ten patients during during FB having significant set-up error in the orientation of anterior to posterior (A/P). Conclusions: ABC system with DIBH could reduced the set-up errors in the orientation of A/P, but not R/L and S/I.',\n",
       " \"Extramammary Paget's disease (PD) is a rare intraepithelial adenocarcinoma, which is most commonly seen in areas rich in apocrine glands. About 60% of extramammary PD were observed in the vulva. Vulvar PD accounts for 1% of vulvar cancers. A 95 years old female patient suffered from erythema, crusting, and increased maceration over the vulvar area for more than two years. A nodule about 1 cm in diameter had also been noted at the time she visited the dermatology department at our hospital. The biopsy showed the tumor cells are positive for CK7, which is supportive for Paget’s disease. In consideration of her old age and poor family support, surgical resection is not feasible. She was referred to the radiation oncology department for radiotherapy. The initial treatment plan was to irradiate the focal region plus 2 cm margin with 6MeV electron to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. However, the treatment was early terminated at 20 Gy due to painful grade III dermatitis. In search of appropriate alternative treatment, 5% imiquimod cream was chosen due to its relatively mild possible adverse effects. The cream was applied on the lesions and up to 2 cm outside their visible margins every other day. After three weeks of topical cream treatment, at least partial response had been observed. She lost of follow-up after 5 weeks of treatment. After repetitively calling her for follow-up, she showed up 6 months later. There were still some suspicious skin lesions although the previously noted nodule was completely gone and most of the patchy lesions were remitted.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose : To compare the acute toxicity and treatment compliance of tri-weekly highdose cisplatin with weekly low-dose cisplatin during concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in head and neck cancer patients. Materials and Methods : From October 2014 to December 2015, a total of 61 head and neck cancer patients who had received CCRT were enrolled. All patients received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with 60-70 Gy in 6 to 7 weeks to the target region. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of either tri-weekly cisplatin 100 mg/m^2 (P100 Q3W, n= 31) or weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m^2 (P30 QW, n= 30). The primary endpoint was acute toxicity during CCRT. The secondary endpoints were the accumulative cisplatin dose, cisplatin dose intensity, and overall treatment period of radiotherapy. Results : The baseline patient characteristics of both studies were similar between both arms. Patients who received P100 Q3W group had a higher rate of Gr 3/4 leucopenia (25.8% vs. 3.3%, p= 0.014) than those who received P30 QW. Other Gr 3/4 toxicities were similar in both arms, including neutropenia (16.1% vs. 3.3%, p= 0.095), anemia (0% vs. 3.3%, p= 0.311), thrombocytopenia (0% vs. 0%, p= 1.000), mucositis (35.5% vs. 23.3%, p= 0.300) and skin reaction (0% vs. 10.0%, p= 0.073). There was no Gr 3/4 serum creatinine elevation in either arm, however more mild grade (Gr 1/2) creatinine elevation was observed in patients who received P100 Q3W (41.9% vs. 16.7%, p= 0.032). The mean accumulative cisplatin dose delivery in the P100 Q3W group and the P30 QW group was 219.4 ± 47.7 mg/m^2 and 181.0 ± 38.9 mg/m^2 (p= 0.001), respectively. The mean dose intensity in P100 Q3W group was 30.9 ± 2.9 mg/m2/week, and 28.4 ± 2.6 mg/m^2/week in the P30 QW group (p= 0.001). The mean overall treatment period of radiotherapy was similar in both groups (50.0 vs. 49.0 days, p= 0.424). Conclusion : The P100 Q3W schedule delivered a significantly higher accumulative cisplatin dose than the P30 QW, but had a higher incidence of severe leucopenia/ neutropenia along with a mild degree of serum creatinine elevation.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: We aim to review treatment outcomes at our institution and evaluate prognostic factors that influence overall survival, progression, and local recurrence. Material and Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma treated from 2000-2014 at our institution. Patients must have received at least one line of therapy. Baseline characteristics and treatment information were extracted from medical records. We employed the Kaplan-Meier product limit method to estimate loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess significance of prognostic factors on treatment outcomes. Results: A total of 21 patients were included, of which 12 (57%) were stage I-II, while the other 9 (43%) were stage IV. Median overall survival for all patients was 2 years. Median survival was significantly longer for stage I-II (3.8 years) than stage IV (2.5 months). In early stage patients, the Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma Prognostic Index (NKPI) was associated with overall survival; patients with clinically positive lymph nodes had a trend towards lower risk of local recurrence (P= 0.05, HR= 0.17). Conclusions: Treatment outcomes of NK/T-cell lymphoma suggest an aggressive pattern and poor outcome, comparable with reports in the literature. Identification of high-risk subgroups and aggressive treatment with modern chemotherapeutic agents, and/or radiotherapy dose escalation may be warranted to improve treatment outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Background: To evaluate the cancer risk in keloid patients and the risk of radiation-associated malignancy in keloid patients who received radiotherapyy (RT) in a population-based study. Materials and Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed keloid who were aged 20 years or above and had no antecedent cancers between 1997 and 2011 were recruited from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. We used standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to calculate the cancer incidence for keloid patients and also for the subgroup of patients who received RT for keloid. Results: A total of 18,646 keloid patients were enrolled. During a median follow-up time of 5.6 years, 338 patients developed cancers. The overall risk of cancer was slightly increased in keloid cohort (SIR 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.24, p= 0.049), especially in women (SIR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.40, p= 0.006). For specific cancer type, the risk of bone and soft tissue sarcoma was significantly elevated (SIR 3.84, 95% CI 1.99-6.71, p＜ 0.001). In the keloid cohort, only 22 (0.12%) patients received RT for keloid treatment. The cancer risk in this subgroup (SIR 2.34, 95% CI 0.28-8.46) cannot be estimated precisely as a consequence of lack of power. Conclusion: Keloids may be associated with an elevated cancer risk, especially for bone and soft tissue sarcoma. The risk of radiation-induced cancers cannot be estimated because the number of keloid patients who received RT is scarce; however, it implies that RT might be underused for treatment of keloids in Taiwan.',\n",

       " \"Purpose: There remains uncertainty whether utilization of 4-dimensional cone-beam computerized tomography (4D-CBCT) has additional benefit over electronic portal image (EPI) in breast radiotherapy. The primary goal of this study was to compare the differences between EPI and 4D-CBCT in evaluating setup errors for breast cancer patients. The secondary aim was to assess the relationship between patient-related factors and setup errors. Materials & Methods: A prospective study with a total of 17 post-operative breast cancer patients was conducted between July 2013 and May 2016. All patients received two kinds of image-guided methods, EPI and 4D-CBCT, before each treatment in the first ten fractions of radiation. The translations in left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions under different image-guided techniques were measured by physicians on-line. Group systematic (Σ) and random errors (σ) for each axis of EPI and 4D-CBCT were calculated. The optimal PTV margins were computed based on van Herk's formula. Differences in daily positioning errors were examined using Wilcoxon singed-ranks test to compare the results between EPI and 4D-CBCT. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to distinguish the significance between the setup errors and the following patient-related factors: age, height, weight, BMI, laterality of breast cancer and the chest ratio of maximal anterior-posterior to lateral diameter measured from simulation images. Results: The total serial images were 170 EPIs and 170 4D-CBCTs. The mean (mm) and standard deviation (mm) of setup errors of EPI and 4D-CBCT were -0.24 ± 0.73 and 0.02 ± 1.17 in LR direction; 0.75 ± 1.40 and 1.54 ± 1.78 in SI direction; 0.27 ± 1.10 and -0.15 ± 1.32 in AP direction, respectively. The systemic (Σ) and random errors (σ) for 4D-CBCT (Σ_(LR)= 1.17 mm, Σ_(AP)= 1.32 mm and σ_(LR)= 1.32 mm, σ_(AP)= 1.49 mm) and EPI (Σ_(LR)= 0.73 mm, Σ_(AP)= 1.10 mm and σ_(LR)= 1.15 mm, σ_(AP)= 1.57 mm) were not significant difference in the LR and AP directions. In the SI direction, the systemic setup errors were significantly different between EPI vs. 4D-CBCT (1.40 mm vs. 1.78 mm; p= 0.005). The calculated PTV margins (mm) measured by EPI and 4D-CBCT were 2.63 and 3.85 in LR direction; 6.09 and 6.68 in SI direction; 3.85 and 4.34 in AP direction, respectively. None of the patient-related factors have conclusive influence on these setup errors. Conclusion : This study found that EPI would significantly underestimate the setup errors in the SI direction compared to 4D-CBCT, which in-turn generates a narrower PTV margin by van Herk's formula. Thus we should be careful when using EPI for correction of inter-fraction setup errors in the SI direction of breast cancer patients. We suggest applying the optimal PTV margins calculated from the 4D-CBCT method for clinical application.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose : To analyze the correlation between body mass index (BMI) and respiration-induced tumor motion, and waist circumference and respiration-induced tumor motion by using different respiratory phases from four dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) Materials and Methods : Ten patients with primary lung cancer or metastatic lung lesion, and eight patients with primary hepatic cancer or metastatic hepatic lesion who received radiotherapy (RT) during Dec. 2014 to Nov. 2015 were included in this study. Data of BMI and waist circumference for each patient were collected. Images from free breathing CT scans and MIP images from 4D-CT scans were obtained for each patient and used for delineating CTV_(NB) and CTV_(MIP), respectively. We calculated the percentage of volume difference (V_(diff)) between CTV_(NB) and CTV_(MIP). Linear regression analysis between V_(diff) and BMI, and V_(diff) and waist circumference were performed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) . Results : For patients with pulmonary tumor, there was no correlation between V_(diff) and BMI, and between V_(diff) and waist circumference. For patients with hepatic tumor, our study showed a significant correlation between V_(diff) and BMI, but no correlation between V_(diff) and waist circumference. According to the correlation analysis in our study, BMI was a factor influencing the magnitude of respiration-induced hepatic tumor motion. Conclusion : Our study showed that there was a significant correlation between V_(diff) and BMI for patients with hepatic tumor. We speculate that the small V_(diff) for patients with hepatic tumor and high BMI was caused by the tumor location which near the diaphragm, and the magnitude of diaphragm motion was easily influenced by the BMI. Therefore, we could design appropriate treatment techniques for breathing control according to the BMI of the patient.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Helical tomotherapy (HT) is a intensity-modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) delivery system that achieves high dose conformality by multileaf collimator motion during treatment. The goal of this study was to evaluate the plan quality and delivery accuracy of the Hi-Art system with different plan parameters for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Materials and Methods: A total of 10 cases were analyzed in this study. Three HT treatments plans were generated for each case in the setting of without block, directional block and complete block respectively to adequately treat the planning target volume and spare the organ at risk. Patient delivery quality assurance (DQA) is an essential task to ensure the accuracy of doses delivered to the patients. The absolute point dose was measured with an Exradin A1SL ion chamber and Tomoelectrometer (Standard Imaging, Middleton, WI) which can be positioned anywhere along the central axis of the phantom, and Gafchromic EBT3 films were placed in the coronal orientation to acquire the planar representations of dose distribution. The measurements were analyzed using the gamma evaluation with the 3% dose and 3 mm distance criteria. Results: The results demonstrate that without block was capable of providing more uniform target doses. The conformation number and homogeneity index of plans without block were better than directional block and complete block. The average MUs was 3338.1, 3871.7, 4761.4 MU, and the delivery times was 237.3, 273.6, 334.3 seconds respectively. The V_5 values for the normal liver was 81.8%, 71.8%, 57.5%. All of the cases passed the 3% point dose difference criteria. The 3% / 3 mm average gamma passing rate was 96.7 ± 2.2%, 95.8 ± 2.8%, 94.6 ± 3.8% for without block, directional block and complete block respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study had demonstrated that the three types of plans can be delivered accurately based on their own QA standards. The major advantage of directional block is to reduce the low dose region of normal liver and just increased approximately 15% of delivery time. The directional block can provide a good choice to the HCC patients with chronic hepatitis.',\n",
       " 'Primary gliosarcoma (GS) is a rare primary tumor of the central nervous system (CNS), and a unique entity among high-grade glioma, composed of both malignant glial and sarcomatous differentiations. The 2016 WHO classification of central nervous tumors classified GS as a grade IV astrocytic neoplasm and a variant of glioblastoma. Due to the rarity of GS, the optimal therapy is not well defined, and the clinical therapies for GS are usually in accordance with glioblastoma guidelines by the mode of maximal surgical resection followed by chemo-radiotherapy with temozolomide. This report describes three rare pathologically confirmed cases of GS in our hospital and analyzes the distinct clinical features, treatment course with more focus on radiotherapy, and their outcome. In our three GS patients, two males and one female with a median age of 61, the main tumors all occurred in the supra-tentorial brain. Two cases are presented with CNS metastasis to different cerebral lobes, and one case with widespread leptomeninges at initial diagnosis. Extra-cranial metastasis is also exhibited in the lungs and pleura during the clinical course. All patients received postoperative radiation therapy with conventional fractionation or hypofractionation regimen. The total radiation dose to the involved brain tumor bed (planning target volume) reached 50 - 60 Gy (range 50.4 to 59.4 Gy). Our results support the role of local radiotherapy after surgery, and the local control effect can be achieved or palliated without obvious side effects. Our cases survived 8 to 23 months with a median survival of 17 months. To highlight the unique clinical features of GS, we conduct a literature review of the reported clinical case series of GS patients in Taiwan and the world using Medline.',\n",
       " 'Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the external auditory canal (EAC) is a rare malignancy which arises from the external ear and invades to surrounding tissues.

       " 'Purpose : The purpose of this article is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and side effects encountered in treating refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN) using the CyberKnife radiosurgery (CKRS). Materials and Methods : Between March 2009 and October 2014, 22 patients with classical TN, refractory to previous medical or surgical treatments, received treatment at our CyberKnife center. The prescription dose of CKRS (range: 60-65 Gy) was delivered to the involved trigeminal nerve root entry zone with a 3-mm gap from the brainstem. Radiation dose to the brainstem was limited to 50% of the maximum dose or no more than 40 Gy. Treatment outcomes were assessed through telephone inquiries and scheduled follow-up visits. Treatment responses were addressed in a standard questionnaire containing the Barrow Neurologic Institute (BNI) pain score and facial numbness score. Results : The median duration of follow-up was 36 months. All patients responded to CKRS, as demonstrated by an improvement in their BNI pain scores. Median time to initial onset of pain relief was 7 days, and to maximal pain relief was 2 months. At the last follow-up, 13 patients (59%) were free from any pain (BNI I); 3 patients (14%) had occasional pain and no need of medication (BNI II), and 6 patients (27%) had moderate pain which was adequately controlled with medications (BNI III). Facial numbness was absent (BNI I) in 5 patients (23%), mild (BNI II) in 13 patients (59%), somewhat bothersome (BNI III) in 2 patients (9%), and very bothersome (BNI IV) in 2 patients (9%). Only 1 patient (4.5%) experienced pain relapse to the pre-CKRS status. Compared with other literatures, higher prescription doses and increased posttreatment numbness were not associated with better outcomes in this study. Conclusions : CKRS is an effective therapy for refractory trigeminal neuralgia. It provided high rates of pain control, early onset of pain relief, and few complications in our cohort.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : This study evaluated the impact of the shoulder displacement in head and neck cancer and observed the reproducibility and stability of the shoulder position in clinical practice. Materials and Methods : This study was divided into the experimental and clinical parts. The experimental displacement of shoulder was evaluated with the Rando phantom. From May 2010 to Dec 2012, four mold groups of 222 patients were HM (head mask), HM + T (head mask with tractor), HSM (head shoulder mask), and HSM + T (head shoulder mask with shoulder tractor) after IRB approval. Setup error was corrected by image-guided system before treatment. Recording to the shoulder displacement error values before and after treatment were determined once a week by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Results : After gradual increasing the shoulder height with 0 cm, 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, the neck dose measured by Rando phantom are 102%, 97.5%, 94.4%, 91.2% and 103%, 99.3% , 95%, 92.5% in D100 and D95, and are 97.4%, 87.5%, 52.2%, 31.2% and 99.5%, 99%, 90%, 75.8% in V100 and V95, respectively. The neck dose is related to the displacement of shoulder. The reproducibility and stability of right and left shoulders displacement were determined as 3D vector during head and neck cancer radiation therapy. The results of right and left shoulders are 11.6±4.1 mm, 10.1±4.1 mm, 5.5±2.0 mm, 5.6±2.6 mm and 3.9±1.8 mm, 4.1±1.3 mm, 2.1±1.1 mm, 3.1±1.5 mm. Conclusion : Compared to HM or HM + T, HSM was more superior. It was recommended that the mold should be chosen approximately to reduce the shoulder displacement and to maintain the stability and reproducibility of radiation therapy. Using a suitable mold can reduce the displacement.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To examine the risk of ocular complications following radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients. Materials and Methods : We identified a radiotherapy cohort (n= 2,733) and a control cohort (n= 375) in the National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2010. The follow-up period was terminated upon developing ocular complications (ICD-9-CM 361, 362, 363, 365, 366) or on December 31, 2010. Results : After adjusting for the confounding factors of the study, the radiotherapy cohort had a higher adjusted hazard ratio (HR; 2.451, 95% CI = 1.087－6.895) of developing ocular complications than did the control cohort. The radiotherapy cohort was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing ocular complications compared with the control cohort when the follow-up period was longer than 36 months (adjusted HR = 2.581, 95% CI = 1.256－5.493). Primary head and neck tumors are mostly located in the nasopharynx and oral cavity. The most common associated ocular complications were retinopathy and cataracts. Conclusions : Patients who receive radiotherapy for head and neck cancer might be at higher risk for developing ocular complications in Taiwan. Radiation oncologists should pay more attention to this association.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare mesenchymal tumor, encompassing tumor previously termed hemangiopericytoma (HPC). The aim of this study is to evaluate both histopathological and clinical factors of intracranial SFT, including tumors previously classified as HPC, and offer an analysis of treatment outcomes based on our experience. Materials & Methods : Between 2002 and 2016, 18 patients with intracranial SFT receiving radiotherapy at our hospital were eligible for this study. Hemangiopericytoma was grouped with grade II SFT, and anaplastic hemangiopericytoma was grouped with grade III SFT since they share similar genetic patterns and clinical prognosis. Clinicopathological and radiotherapy data were extracted from patient’s medical record. Radiotherapy was administered by either conventional fractionated radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. The planning system includes Varian Medical System and BrainLab system. Results : Reviewing operative records, gross total resection was performed in 14 (77.8%) cases, while the remaining 4 (22.2%) cases had subtotal resection. All patients underwent postoperative RT. Before radiation therapy at our department, ten patients received one operation for SFT, four patients received two operations and the other four patients received more than two operations. Twelve patients received conventional fractionated radiotherapy and 6 received stereotactic radiosurgery. The median dose is 55.5 Gy (range 30 － 60 Gy) for fractionated RT and 16 Gy (range 15 － 16 Gy) for SRS. The median target volume for patients who received fractionated radiotherapy was 123.8 cm^3 (49.1 － 237.0 cm^3) and 5.84 cm^3 (range 3.5 － 29.24 cm^3) for those who received stereotactic radiosurgery. Median follow-up time was 73.6 months. Five and 10 years overall survival rates were 70.5%, and 47.0%, respectively. Tumors reoccurred as intracranial recurrence only (n= 3), and extracranial metastasis alone (n= 4). Local control rate at 5 years was 90.9%. The 5-year metastasis-free rate was 100.0% for grade II (n= 9) tumors and 40.0% for grade III tumors (n= 9) (p= 0.02). There was a trend toward improved progression-free rate in low-grade tumors, with a 5-year progression-free rate of 83.3% for grade II, and 34.3% for grade III tumors (p= 0.09). There was no significant difference for overall survival, progression free rate or local control rates by extent of surgery in this study. Conclusion : For patients with intracranial SFTs, resection remains the initial treatment and postoperative radiotherapy provides an effective and safe adjuvant management option. Histological grading is the most significant prognostic factor.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : The role of adjuvant radiotherapy after curative surgery to advanced stage urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) of the renal pelvis or ureter has not been proven in large randomized controlled trials. The purpose of this study is to review the outcomes and toxicities of adjuvant radiotherapy for advanced stage upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) of the renal pelvis or ureter in our single institution. Materials and Methods : We collected the patients with the diagnosis of UTUC of the renal pelvis or ureter, who received nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff resection (NUR+BCR) and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in our institution from 2006 to 2015. Clinicopathologic features, treatment modalities, toxicities and outcome variables were retrospectively reviewed. Adjuvant RT was given with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique for all the patients. Systemic chemotherapy (C/T) was administered at the physician’s discretion of medical oncologists. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and bladder-recurrence-free survival (BRFS). A subgroup analysis of treatment toxicities and failure pattern between the RT-alone group and C/T-combined group were also performed. Results : Twenty patients were eligible for the final analysis. All the patients received curative surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy with IMRT technique. Median dose of RT was 50.4 Gy (range 45.0 to 64.8 Gy). Median follow-up time was 2.67 years. The estimated 3-year OS, LRFS, DMFS and BRFS were 65.8%, 81.5%, 73.3% and 92.3%. We found that the patients with positive or close surgical margins had inferior overall survival (p= .001). No significant difference could be demonstrated in survival outcome between the groups with or without C/T administration. None of the patients experienced grade 3 or higher acute toxicities in our study. Conclusions : Adjuvant radiotherapy with IMRT technique after curative surgery for advanced stage UTUC patients achieved a comparable outcome with acceptable patient compliance and adverse events in our institution. The benefit of chemotherapy needs further elucidation through novel prospective studies.',\n",
       " \"Purpose : Effective management of patient data, timely completion of records, and patient scheduling issues are important but tedious tasks. We developed and implemented a web-based oncology information system to facilitate management of patient records and task scheduling. Material and Methods: We developed a web-based interface and underlying database aimed to facilitate capture of patient-related information. This system dynamically presents patients currently on-treatment and patients on the waiting list, and also keeps track of due medical records. Integration with imaging, lab, and electronic medical record systems allows rapid physician access to relevant data. Scheduling capability was also implemented. Results : Since implementation of the system in September 2007, the database now contains over 15,000 entries. This system can be used anywhere in the hospital with Intranet access. Data is displayed according to defined privileges: physicians can easily access patient medical data, while departmental staff handles scheduling at ease. Department-wide patient demographics, patient throughput, and machine usage statistics generated by this system provides invaluable insight to aid management. Recently, several new features, including integration with Cancer Center subsystems and the ability to review residents' notes have been added to meet user needs. Conclusions: We implemented a web-based system tailored to radiation oncology workflow. This system allows physicians to keep track of patient status and provides administrative insight. The ability to progressively incorporate new functions is a highlight feature of our system.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose : The Varian TrueBeam system is a modern radiotherapy unit. Undesired neutrons are produced by the interaction of high-energy (＞10 MV) photons with high-Z components such as the flattening filter (FF) and jaws. The new design of the Varian TrueBeam system enables the linac to be operated in the flattening-filter-free (FFF) mode, as well as in the FF mode. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the neutron ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), around the TrueBeam linac in the FF and FFF modes by using a wide energy neutron detection instrument (WENDI-II). Materials and Methods : Ten-megavolt X-ray beams were used in the FF and FFF modes, with the jaws and multileaf collimators fully closed. The dose delivery rates were set to 600 MU/min in the FF mode and 2400 MU/min in the FFF mode. The H*(10) was measured using the WENDI-II located at the isocenter, 50 and 100 cm away from the isocenter, and at the entrance and exit of the maze. The dose delivery was set to 200 MU. Result : The H*(10) was proportional to the monitor unit and declined with increasing distance to the isocenter. The distribution of scattered neutrons did not appear to be isotropic; the H*(10) was somewhat higher in the gun-target direction. The neutron ambient dose equivalent in the FFF mode was 30.8 μSv, lower than the 92.5 μSv detected in the FF mode. In the FFF mode, the neutron ambient dose equivalent in the maze decreased to 6.71 μSv. Conclusion : Operating the TrueBeam system in the FFF mode greatly decreases the level of undesired neutrons. It also corresponds to a reduction in activation within the treatment vault and subsequent exposure to patients and radiotherapists.',\n",
       " 'Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) of the pancreas is very rare. Obstructive jaundice is by far the commonest symptom, followed by abdominal pain. About 80% of pancreatic EMPs are located in the head of the pancreas, whilst the remaining 20% are found in the body and/or the tail of the organ. The computed tomography (CT) appearance of pancreatic EMP is typically described as a multilobular solid hypodense mass with homogeneous intravenous contrast enhancement. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-fine needle aspiration (FNA) has been proven as the most effective means for making a definitive cytological diagnosis of a pancreatic mass. To date, a standardized treatment for EMPs of the pancreas has not been established. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and bypass procedures either alone or in combination have been described. Owing to the highly radiosensitive nature of plasma cell tumors, radiotherapy has been suggested as the treatment of choice. There is scarce information about results of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the treatment of EMP of the pancreas. IMRT can deliver adequate target coverage while minimizing the dose to critical organs. We report a case of EMP of the pancreas treated with IMRT. Our patient remains alive and without recurrence at long-term follow-up (more than five years).',\n",

       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the influence of skull base abnormality on prognosis and correlation with intracranial invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Materials and Methods: Total 812 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed NPC who underwent staging computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of primary tumor extension were enrolled in this study. All radiologic images were reviewed and assessed for intracranial extension and skull base invasion. Results: Tumor invasion of the foramen ovale, petrous portion of the temporal bone, clivus and the pterygopalatine fossa associated with intracranial involvement. The number in site of skull base lesions showed significant differences in local failure-free survival. Foramen ovale, petrous portion of the temporal bone and pterygopalatine fossa involvement also showed impact on local failure-free survival. Conclusions: Involvement of the skull base such as foramen ovale, petrous portion of the temporal bone, clivus, and pterygopalatine fossa could be good predictors of intracranial involvement in NPC and all except clivus affected local failure-free survival.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To retrospectively review the treatment outcome of esophageal cancer in single institution, and compare the efficacy and toxicity of helical tomotherapy with step-and-shoot Intensity Modulation Radiation Therapy (IMRT). Materials and Methods: Between 2007 and 2012, 67 consecutive patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, cT2-4N0-3M0, received definitive CCRT. The radiotherapy was delivered with helical tomotherapy in 34 patients, and with step-and-shoot IMRT in 33 patients. We evaluated the outcomes of overall survival rate (OS), disease-free survival rate (DFS), local control rate (LC), distant metastasis-free survival rate (DMFS), toxicity of radiation pneumonitis incidence, and dose distributions to lung and heart. The grading of toxicity was evaluated using CTCAE version 3.0. Result: The median follow-up was 12.1 months. The median overall survival among all patients was 15 months. The treatment outcomes between tomotherapy and step-and-shoot IMRT revealed median OS time 15 months vs. 13.4 months；1 year、2 year OS rates were 69% vs. 60.6%、29.8% vs. 26.7% (p = 0.48)；1 year、2 year DFS rates were 38.4% vs. 29.2%、21.3% vs. 16.7% (p = 0.63)；1 year、2 year LC rates were 49.3% vs. 48.7%、32.9% vs. 39.0% (p = 0.75)；1 year、2 year DMFS rates were 76.5% vs. 61.4%、68.8% vs. 39.8% (p = 0.046). No significant differences in OS, DFS, and LC rates were found between tomotherapy and IMRT. There was no significant difference in LC rate with higher radiation dose (＞ 50 Gy vs. ≦50 Gy). The patients using tomotherapy had less incidence of radiation pneumonitis (2.9%) than IMRT (21.2%；p = 0.027), and favorable dose distribution to lung with V20：21.9% vs. 25.7% (p = 0.03), and mean lung dose 14.8 Gy vs. 15.3 Gy (p = 0.47) compared with IMRT. There was also better dose distribution to heart in tomotherapy which V30 was 27.8% vs. 39.6% (p = 0.02), and mean heart dose was 22 Gy vs. 26.3 Gy (p = 0.096). Conclusion: In our retrospective analysis at single institution, CCRT using tomotherapy for esophageal cancer could reduce dose to normal organs including lung and heart, and reduce incidence of radiation pneumonitis when compared with step-and-shoot IMRT. The treatment outcomes in OS, DFS, and LC rates were similar.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study compared the treatment efficacy of tomotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and tangential field in field (FIF) for bilateral breast cancer. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 10 patients with breast cancer in this study. All patients had early stage breast cancer (pTis, T1, or T2). A total dose of 5040 cGy was administered for adjuvant breast irradiation with IMRT and tomotherapy for each patient in the treatment planning system. In this study, we compared the treatment efficacy of tangential field-in-field (FIF), IMRT and tomotherapy for bilateral breast cancer. We analyzed the bilateral whole-breast dose coverage, conformity and homogeneity indices, and dose-volume constraints of normal tissues (the right and left lungs and heart). Results: Tomotherapy was more efficient than IMRT and FIF, exhibiting significant improvements in reducing the volume of normal tissues (heart mean doses: tomotherapy = 3.67 Gy, IMRT = 4.51 Gy and FIF = 4.84 Gy; p ＜ 0.05). Moreover, tomotherapy required a lower mean lung dose (right lung mean dose = 6.44, 9.08 and 10.03 Gy for tomotherapy, IMRT and FIF, respectively; p ＜ 0.05; left lung mean dose = 6.33, 7.85 and 8.64 Gy for tomotherapy, IMRT and FIF, respectively; p = 0.0002). We also showed the mean doses of coronary artery and left anterior descending artery (LAD): tomotherapy = 12.07 and 19.41 Gy, IMRT = 16.99 and 27.86 Gy, FIF = 19.24 and 30.94 Gy, respectively. The conformity indices (V_(95%)/V_(PTV)) of the right and left breasts were 1.08 ± 0.01 and 1.07 ± 0.02 for tomotherapy, respectively, and 1.07 ± 0.02 and 1.08 ± 0.01 for IMRT, and 1.12 ± 0.03 and 1.11 ± 0.01, respectively, in FIF respectively. Moreover, the homogeneity indices of the right and left breasts were 1.36 ± 0.08 and 1.53 ± 0.46 for tomotherapy, respectively, and 1.65 ± 0.44 and 1.51 ± 0.26 for IMRT, respectively and 1.82 ± 0.51 and 1.78 ± 0.32, respectively, in FIF. Conclusion: Tomotherapy significantly reduced the dose volume of the heart and mean dose for the lungs and coronary vessels. However, long-term follow-up is warranted to ensure low normal tissue toxicity in these patients.',\n",
       " 'Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain tumor. Combined surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), and temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard treatment of care, but the outcome is still grave. Thus, novel therapeutic targets are actively researched in translational studies. Modulation of autophagy by simultaneous administration of the inducer, sirolimus (Rapamycin), and the inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), breaks the vicious cycle of energy supply from the tumor microenvironment (TME) to cancer cells. This strategy was called the ＂autophagy paradox＂. It has been applied to a variety of cancers to reverse drug resistance. A line of evidences including GBM are characterized by low autophagy capacity and highly dependent on the help of TME to provide energy source and biochemical building blocks for tumor growth and survival. Based on literature review and our experience, we hypothesize that add-on ＂autophagy paradox＂ strategy to standard RT-TMZ will be advantageous to GBM treatment.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand the consequence of MLC systematic errors on the VMAT technique in the dose distribution. Material and Methods: Five VMAT treatment plans (multiTumor, Prostate, Head, C_loose_plan, and C_strict_plan) followed TG-119 instructions were created. MLC systematic errors were simulated for error magnitudes of ±0.5 mm, ±1 mm, ±2 mm, and ±3 mm in X1 bank (+ open, - close). The 3 mm/3% and 2 mm/2% gamma index analysis and PTVs and OARs equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were used to evaluate the impact of MLC systematic errors on the dose distribution and the biological dose parameter. Materials and Methods: In total 97 patients with breast cancer were included, they were treated with hybrid intensity-modulated radiotherapy (Hybrid IMRT) for 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Patients were evaluated at three months after treatment through the observation of the change of chest computed tomography image. The final endpoint of complication was according to Arriagada's classification. Patients with grade 1+ change on CT images were defined as a complication of radiation pneumonitis. We evaluated the correlation of radiation pneumonitis and mean ipsilateral lung dose. We established LKB NTCP model through calculated the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) of ipsilateral lung and validated the model performance. The NTCP model was mainly used to investigate the dose-response curve for complications of radiation pneumonitis and provided dose parameters to prevent complication of endemic breast cancer patients. Result: The average 3 mm/3% and 2 mm/2% gamma index passing rate was decreased by 11.69% per mm and 18.44% per mm in the open direction and 9.73% per mm and 15.30% per mm in the close direction. The tolerance of MLC systematic errors to achieve ＞ 90% criteria for 3%/3 mm and 2 mm/2% gamma analysis was 0.86 mm and 0.54 mm in the open direction and 1.03 mm and 0.65 mm in the close direction. The impact of average EUD difference on PTVs and OARs was 6.30% per mm and 5.20% per mm. Conclusion: The present study suggested that the tolerance of systemic MLC errors was 1mm. Radiation treatment centers should have adequate MLC quality assurance program to ensure clinical outcomes and avoid serious complications.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To study the influence of the static field width (FW) and modulation factor (MF) on the organs at risk (OAR) dose and treatment time of nasopharyngeal cancer by Tomotherapy. Materials and Methods: CT scan of RANDO phantom were used to prepare the radiotherapy treatment plan. Planning target volume and the organs at risk (OAR) corresponding to nasopharyngeal cancer were contoured in the CT scan. 63 Tomotherapy plans with the same parameter setting (importance and penalty) were obtained with static FW value including 1 cm, 2.5 cm, and 5 cm, combined with the different value of MF (range of 1.0-5.0 with step 0.2). Result: Treatment plan with different FW resulted a significant difference in the OAR dose (p ＜ 0.0001). For each computer plan group (FW 1 cm, 2.5 cm and 5 cm), average dose of the parotid gland was higher than the limit value (26 Gy) when the MF value is less than or equal to 1.8. When the MF value was set at 1.0, the maximum dose of spinal cord and brain stem were higher than OAR limits (45 Gy and 54 Gy, respectively). The treatment time with different FW (1, 2.5 and 5 cm) were 1036, 440, 249 seconds, respectively. In the 27 selected quality assurance (QA) plans, the measured dose point was within ± 3%. The gamma pass percentage (3%/ 3 mm) was between 90.1% and 92.3%. Conclusion: The clinical priority to reduce absorbed dose of critical organ, optimized algorithm with MF 2.8 plus a FW 1cm combination were suggested. The second choice combination was MF 3.4 plus FW 2.5 cm. However, small field width will significantly increase treatment time. Considering some patient could not lie down for too long, treatment time could be shortened with combination of MF 3.6 plus FW 5 cm.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC), mostly seen in the nasopharynx, is a rare cancer of the hypopharynx. LEC is characterized by an undifferentiated non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a significant lymphocytic infiltration, and is histopathologically similar to non-keratinizing, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC), but is less associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Case report: In this study, we report the diagnosis and treatment by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) of a 71-year-old male hypopharyngeal LEC patient in Aug 2014. The patient completed the CCRT treatment course. In the follow-up image survey half a year after treatment, a partial tumor response was noted. Further, complete regression was achieved in the following image survey 9 months after treatment. Discussion: In this rare case of advanced stage, non-EBV related hypopharyngeal LEC, a good response to definitive CCRT was achieved within the 15-month follow-up period. However, more patients are required to define the optimal treatment for hypopharyngeal LEC.',\n",
       " 'We describe a rare case of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT). A 69-year-old male underwent orthotopic LT for primary HCC outside of Milan criteria due to incomplete embolization. Sixteen months after LT, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed two recurrent tumors in the liver graft. The patient underwent combined TACE and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to treat the recurrent lesions. Twenty-eight months after completion of combined treatment, the patient is doing well without experiencing any acute or chronic adverse effect. Surveillance images demonstrated complete regression and no evidence of recurrence. This case suggests that this dual-modality treatment in the post-transplant setting may help to improve local control and potentially survival in those recipients who develop recurrent HCC within the liver graft.',\n",
       " 'Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) is a rare aggressive tumor of the olfactory mucosa which was first described by Berger et al. in 1924. ENB has been traditionally treated with radical surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Nevertheless, these rare tumors are still associated with high rates of tumor recurrence and mortality. Studies have shown that surgery with postoperative radiotherapy offers a longer overall survival when compared with single modality treatment. We present an advanced case of ENB who was successfully treated with RapidArc (VMAT) technique. A 72 year-old male Taiwanese farmer was seen at the ENT outpatient clinic complaining of productive cough, nasal obstruction, loss of smell sensation and purulent rhinorrhea for 1 month, the patient also complained of yellow to reddish nasal discharge for 10 years. MRI on 2013/03/04 revealed a strongly enhanced right anterior cranial fossa epidural mass (48 x 40 x 44 mm) with a cystic component invading the right ethmoid sinus. No significant neck lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient was diagnosed as Kadish stage C, Hyams grade III ENB. Treatment consisted of giving a cumulative dose of 7000 cGy using the RapidArc technique concurrently with cisplatin and etoposide. The patient is still disease-free 39 months after CCRT.',\n",
       " 'Background : The benefits of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer after D2 lymph node dissection remain debatable. This study investigated the treatment outcome in patients with stage II-III gastric cancer receiving curative resection plus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method : Between January 2006 and December 2013, 71 patients who underwent radiotherapy with a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma were registered. Tumors were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria (AJCC) version 7.0. Forty patients who had stage II and III disease undergoing curative resection were included in this analysis. Of them, 38 patients (95%) received D2 lymph node dissection. The RT field included tumor bed, remnant stomach, and regional lymph nodes with a standard prescribed dose of 45 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, or fluorouracil plus leucovorin. The study endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), both of which were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method. The log-rank test and Cox regression analysis were performed to examine the effects of explanatory variables on OS and PFS. Result : 30 patients died in the median follow-up duration of 22.8 months (range, 3.2 ~ 76.5), Thirty-four (80%) experienced recurrent disease (distant metastasis in 29, local relapse in 11, regional recurrence in 10). Twenty-four patients had grade 2 or above acute gastrointestinal or hematological toxicities. Three patients (8%) died from neutropenic infection during the adjuvant CRT. Multivariate analyses showed pathological T4b stage [P = .02, HR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.16–5.46] and pathological N3b stage [P = .008, HR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.28–5.32] were the independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS, respectively. Conclusion : In stage II-III gastric cancer patients receiving adjuvant CRT, treatmentrelated toxicities were the major concerns. Pathological T4b was the independent prognostic factor for OS, whereas N3b for PFS. A multi-institutional trial is recommended to optimize the treatment strategy and patient selection.',\n",

While stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as a treatment option for HCC, there are limited data on treatment outcomes and associated prognostic factors focusing on PVTT patients. Methods and Materials : Between 2008 and 2013, 42 HCC patients with PVTT underwent SABR using a Cyberknife radiosurgery system in our institute. The mean radiation dose was 42.5 Gy, 5–12.5 Gy per fraction. We collected clinical and treatment-related factors including age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, α-fetoprotein (AFP) level, Child-Pugh score, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score, presence of extrahepatic metastasis (EM), and equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). The patients were assessed for radiographic response and survival outcome. Image response was evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier test. Prognostic factors were evaluated using a Cox regression model. Results : At the last follow up, 38 patients had died. The median survival was 8.6 months, with 1-year and 2-year OS rates of 31.4% and 14.1%, respectively. Nine patients died before imaging studies for response evaluation could be performed. In those who had radiographic response evaluation, 3% had a complete response, 55% a partial response, 39% stable disease, and 3% disease progression. Nine (21%) patients had portal vein re-canalization and then received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). In univariate analysis, Child-Pugh A (vs. B & C, HR = 0.470, p = 0.049), CLIP score ≤ 3 (vs. ＞ 3, HR = 0.468, p = 0.046), and absence of EM (vs. presence of EM, HR = 0.497, p = 0.035) were associated with a higher OS rate. Multivariate analysis showed that only an absence of EM (vs. presence of EM, HR = 0.340, p = 0.015) was a significant prognostic indicator. Conclusions : SABR is an option for HCC patients with PVTT. Absence of EM is the only independent prognostic factor for better OS. A future large-scale study to identify strict patient selection criterion may maximize the benefits of SABR.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To investigate the correlation of the ipsilateral lung dose and radiation pneumonitis of breast cancer after radiotherapy, we established Lyman Lyman Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model to study the corresponding dose of complication. Materials and Methods : In total 97 patients with breast cancer were included, they were treated with hybrid intensity-modulated radiotherapy (Hybrid IMRT) for 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Patients were evaluated at three months after treatment through the observation of the change of chest computed tomography image. The final endpoint of complication was according to Arriagada’s classification. Patients with grade 1+ change on CT images were defined as a complication of radiation pneumonitis. We evaluated the correlation of radiation pneumonitis and mean ipsilateral lung dose. We established LKB NTCP model through calculated the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) of ipsilateral lung and validated the model performance. The NTCP model was mainly used to investigate the dose-response curve for complications of radiation pneumonitis and provided dose parameters to prevent complication of endemic breast cancer patients. Result : Radiation pneumonitis was significantly correlated with mean ipsilateral lung dose. The fitted LKB NTCP parameters were: TD50 = 21.26 Gy (95% CI, 19.78 - 22.97), m = 0.32 (95% CI, 0.19 - 0.81). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the NTCP model was 0.65. The model was passing through model performance validations, including Brier score, Hosmer- Lemeshow test and the calibration curve. Conclusion : We established Lyman Kutcher Burman normal tissue complication probability model for breast cancer radiation pneumonitis in this study, and defined the correlated parameters for endemic patients. We can apply these parameters to breast cancer radiation treatment planning evaluation, avoid radiation pneumonitis, and improve the patients’ quality of life after radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Introduction : To compare stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and Cyberknife for huge hepatocellular carcinoma (≥10 cm) using dosimetric analysis. Methods and Materials : Ten patients with huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the right liver lobe treated with Cyberknife SBRT were enrolled in this study. The dosimetric values for 3D-CRT, IMRT and Cyberknife were calculated for total doses of 40 Gy / 5 fx. Treatments were individualized on the basis of the effective liver volume irradiated maintaining ≤ 5 % risk of radiation-induced liver disease (V15 Gy to ≤ 700 ml normal liver volume). Other parameters included the conformal index (CI), homogeneity index (HI) and hot spot (Dmax) for the planning target volume (PTV). Results : The GTV was covered adequately by all techniques PTV coverage of Cyberknife was comparable to 3D-CRT and IMRT (p= 0.0544); CI of IMRT were significantly lower than 3D-CRT and Cyberknife (p=0.0082). While HI and Dmax were significantly lower with 3D-CRT than with IMRT and Cyberknife (p= 0.0001). Conclusions : SBRT with Cyberknife provided an option for huge HCC in the right lobe although tumor coverage compared with 3D-CRT or IMRT was of borderline significance. IMRT and 3D-CRT resulted in a more conformal and homogenous plan than Cyberknife. And in terms of organ sparing, 3D-CRT was the most effective in the sparing of non-liver organs. However, Cyberknife had the advantage for accurate target localization by real time tracking as compared with other SBRT modalities and eliminated the discomfort of abdominal compression or respiratory control used in other SBRT techniques.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : The study aims to optimize the initial parameters and calculating efficiency in Monte Carlo simulation for Cyberknife G3 system. Materials and Methods : BEAM09 Monte Carlo codes were applied in this study. The BEAMnrc code was used to simulate the treatment head and generate the phase space files. The DOSXYZnrc code was used to calculate the depth dose curves (percentage depth dose, PDD), lateral profiles and the output factors. Mean energy and the FWHMR were used to determine initial electron parameters. For calculating dose in the region of interest, the use of smaller voxel size may increase the calculation time; conversely, the adaption of larger voxel size may cause a higher partial volume effect. This study aims to investigate the optimal voxel size for dose calculation in a water phantom to achieve reasonable simulation efficiency and an acceptable accuracy. The Kα method was used for the optimization by comparing the differences between diode measurement data and MC simulations in PDDs and profiles. Disagreement between simulation and measurement were evaluated through the dose differences of PDDs from depths of 1.5 to 20 cm, and the lateral profiles of 80% field width. Distance to agreement (DTA) at lateral positions of 20% to 80% dose profiles of penumbra region were also used for the comparisons. Result : For the efficiency of dose calculation, setting the voxel size equal to one tenth of field width would produce optimal simulation efficiency and acceptable accuracy. According to these parameters, the dose differences of the PDDs were about 1% from depths of 1.5 to 20 cm, the dose differences for lateral profiles within 80% field width were also within 1.5%, and the disagreements of DTA were less than 0.5 mm. The discrepancies of output factor were from 2.8 to 5% for the three smallest cones, which were possibly caused by the effect of electron scattering at the metallic parts of the detector shielding. Conclusion : For Monte Carlo simulations of LINAC and dose calculations, it is important to accurately determine the initial electron beam. These parameters, mean energy and FWHM of incidence electron, have been determined by matching the calculated dose with the measured dose through a trial and error process. This study also applied some methods to increase simulation efficiency which could be the reference of future research.',\n",
       " 'Introduction : Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a plasma protein produced by the fetal hepatocytes, yolk sac cells and some fetal gastrointestinal cells, is the tumor marker mostly used for the screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, AFP is not only elevated in HCC, but also in some rare cancers, such as germ cell tumors and, even more rarely, in AFP-producing pancreatic, gastric, colon and lung cancers. The incidence of elevated serum levels of AFP in pancreatic carcinomas has been reported to be 2.1%–24.0%. Most of the AFP-producing pancreatic cancers are pancreatoblastomas occurring in children or acinar cell carcinomas. The mean age of AFP-producing pancreatic cancers was among 50 years old. Case report : We reported a 64y/o male, with AFP-producing pancreatic cancer, ductal adenocarcinoma, diagnosed and treated by near total pancreatectomy and adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) in Oct. 2011. The patient completed the treatment course of CCRT. There was neither local nor regional recurrence in the image survey, during the 4 years follow-up. The AFP level decreased after CCRT treatment course started, and the AFP level was around 2 ng/ml thereafter, confirmed by the quarterly laboratory examinations. Discussion : In this reported rare case of, ductal adenocarcinoma, stage Ib, good treatment response was achieved with near total pancreatectomy and adjuvant CCRT in the four years follow-up so far, without any severe side effect. However, this may benefit from the early detection and early treatment. More patients were warranted to define the optimal treatment for AFP-producing pancreatic cancer.',\n",
       " 'Esophagopericardial fistula (EPF) secondary to esophageal cancer is a rare complication with high mortality rate. Here, we present a case of esophageal cancer patient who developed EPF and purulent pericarditis with cardiac tamponade during the course of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. A 54-year-old man who was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of middle to low third esophagus staged as cT3N1M0 underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy with radical intent. He received a cumulative radiotherapy dose of 28 Gy in 14 fractions to the esophageal tumor and perigastric lymphadenopathy using intensity modulated radiotherapy and one course of concomitant chemotherapy using cisplatin + infusional 5-fluorouracil. There was a treatment break of 3 days due to severe fatigue, dysphagia, and chest wall pain. He was brought to our emergency department due to cold sweating and syncope at the bathroom. Echocardiography revealed small ventricular size due to moderate pericardial effusion. Computed tomography showed encapsulated fluid collection with air bubbles over mediastinum adjacent to the previous tumor site and pericardial effusion. Under the impression of EPF and purulent pericarditis with cardiac tamponade, pericardiocentesis, pigtail tube drainage and antibiotic were instituted. The patient was discharged from hospital on the day 18 with a stable condition. We assume that the EPF observed in this patient may be caused by the location of middle to lower thoracic esophageal tumor, and the anterior wall closed to pericardium of the left atrium, tumor shrinkage combined chronic inflammation and through and through ulcerated esophageal tumor to the pericardium. EPF with purulent pericarditis is an acute and fulminant disease that has high mortality rate if delayed diagnosed and treated. Because some of the symptoms of EPF formation mimic those discomfort arising from esophageal cancer and chemoradiotherapy, it will go unnoticed unless a high index of suspicion has been placed. In the case of the lower third thoracic esophageal tumor and anterior wall close to the pericardium, we should maintain a high index of suspicion of this life-threatening complication during and after chemoradiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Cardiac metastasis from head and neck cancer is rarely seen, while a lung primary would be the most common original anatomic site of cardiac metastasis. A 50-year-old man with the underlying disease of Child C liver cirrhosis underwent a liver transplantation on February 19, 2014 and took tacrolimus for prevention of graft rejection. However, a mass over right tongue border was found by the patient himself at the end of February, 2014. The patient then underwent total glossectomy and right modified radical neck dissection on June 26, 2014. Pathology report showed squamous cell carcinoma of oral tongue, pT4aN2cM0, stage IVA. Postoperative radiation therapy was started on July 22, 2014. However, the patient developed shortness of breath, cold sweating and tachycardia on August 8, 2014 after a cumulative radiation dose of 26 Gy. Coronary arteriogram showed patent coronary arteries. However, echocardiogram found a tumor mass on the right ventricle of the heart with partial cardiac flow obstruction. Chest computer tomography (CT) also showed a necrotic soft tissue mass on right ventricle of the heart, the symptom exacerbated in following two weeks. He was finally transferred for hospice care on August 25, 2014. The patient passed away on August 27, 2014. The immuno-suppressive drugs for rejection prevention may be associated with the occurrence of rare cardiac metastasis.',\n",
       " 'Background : This study evaluated cranial nerve (CN) involvement and the outcomes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Method : This study recruited 230 patients with histologically proven NPC without metastasis who were treated with IMRT at our institution between 2007 and 2013. Twenty-two patients had CN involvement. The primary tumor and involved lymph nodes were prescribed 69.96-70 Gy, the microscopic areas were prescribed 59.4-63 Gy, and clinically negative neck regions were prescribed 54.45-56 Gy in 33–35 fractions. Twenty-one patients with CN involvement received RT combined with chemotherapy. Result : The incidence of CN involvement was 9.6%. The most commonly involved CNs were the trigeminal (59.1%) and abducens nerves (45.5%), with the most commonly presenting symptoms being neuroophthalmic manifestations (68.2%), followed by facial numbness or pain (45.5%). The 3-year overall survival (OS), local relapse-free survival (LRFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 79.2%, 82.9%, and 50.0% respectively. Significant differences were observed in the 3-year OS rate (100% vs 43.7%, p = 0.016) and DFS (77.8% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.014) between patients with pretreatment neurological symptoms that presented for less than 3 months and more than 3 months. Patients with complete recovery of neurological symptoms after treatment tended to exhibit higher 3-year DFS (100% vs. 30.0%, p = 0.071). Single or multiple CN involvement and clinically or radiologically diagnosed CN involvement were not prognosticators for NPC patients with CN involvement. No temporal lobe necrosis was noted as the late effect. Conclusion : The pretreatment duration of neurological symptoms is a significant prognostic factor for the OS and DFS of NPC patients with CN palsy. Patients with a complete neurological response after treatment tend to exhibit higher DFS (p = 0.071). However, the outcome of NPC patients with CN palsy is not affected by the extensive involvement of CN lesions or the mode of diagnosis, either clinical or radiological.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To report 8-year long-term outcomes for localized prostate cancer patients treated with the combination of high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Materials and Methods : One hundred and twenty-one Stage T1c to T3b prostate cancer patients treated with HDR-BT plus EBRT were included. An HDR dose of 16.5 Gy in 3 fractions over 24 hours was given 2 weeks before EBRT. An EBRT dose of 50.4 Gy was administered to the prostate and seminal vesicles. Younger patients (aged under 75 years) with greater than 15% risk of nodal metastasis received whole-pelvis RT (45 Gy in 25 fractions) as part of EBRT. Results : Forty-nine percent of patients belonged to the high-risk (T3a or Gleason score 8–10 or prostate specific antigen greater than 20 ng/mL) or very-high-risk (T3b) groups. After a median follow-up of 125 months (range, 22-168 months), 8-year biochemical control rate was 80% (100%, 90%, 71%, and 20% respectively, for patients in the low, intermediate, high, and very-high-risk groups). Biochemical failure was noted in 25 patients. Two patients experienced late biochemical failure (108 and 129 months after EBRT). 8-year overall and cancer-specific survivals were 91% and 99%. Six patients (5%) had grade 3 implant-related acute urinary retention due to hematuria. Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were limited, but 7 (6%) patients had episodes of grade 3 chronic genitourinary (GU) toxicities, including urethral stricture and severe hematuria. Whole-pelvis EBRT is a major contributing factor to acute but not to chronic GI toxicities. Among 84 patients with pretreatment sexual potency, 30% retained potency at 5 years. Conclusion : HDR-BT plus EBRT can achieve satisfactory long-term biochemical control with acceptable complications for T1c-T3a prostate cancer patients.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery has been widely accepted for treating locally advanced esophageal cancer except cervical esophageal cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of preoperative CCRT followed by surgery for cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with intent to preserve the larynx. Materials & Methods : From August 2013 to August 2015, 11 patients with cervical esophageal SCC scheduled to receive preoperative CCRT with surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The gross tumor and involved lymphadenopathies were delivered with 48 Gy and 43.2 Gy to subclinical mucosal/submucosal disease and regional lymphatic basin in 24 fractions by simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) planning through intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or Tomotherapy. Chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m^2 was administered during radiation therapy (RT) course. Side effects grading was according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). The image assessment and pathological responses were recorded and graded. Results : Among all 11 patients, ten of them had received the planned CCRT completely and one was dead due to aspiration pneumonia and sepsis during CCRT course. Of the 10 patients who completed preoperative CCRT, 8 patients of them have received esophagectomy. The pathological T down-staging was noted in 4 patients (50%) and pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 1 patient (12.5%). Seven of these 8 patients (87.5%) preserved the larynx and 6 patients (75%) achieved negative surgical margins (R0 resection). The most severe acute toxicities from CCRT were grade 3 cough (n=1, 10%) and grade 3 anemia (n=1, 10%). According to chest surgeons’ consensus, the cut-off point for larynx-preserving surgery after CCRT for cervical esophageal cancer could be 2-cm distance from esophageal tumor to larynx. Conclusion : Preoperative CCRT followed by larynx-sparing surgery is feasible in cervical esophageal SCC. The preliminary results can be used as a reference for further clinical validation of multimodality therapy in cervical esophageal SCC with intent to improve tumor control and quality of life.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : The application of post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in N1 breast cancer patients is still no consensus according to the St. Gallen meeting in 2015. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of PMRT on survivals in N1 breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods : Data were obtained from the cancer registry database and national health insurance claim data in Taiwan. We selected early breast cancer (T1-T2) and N1 lymph node metastasis patient treated with and without PMRT. Total 6,257 patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 were identified. We compared overall survival and disease-free survival between patients with and without PMRT. Propensity score matching and sensitivity analysis were performed. Result : We identified 2,866 (46%) patients with PMRT and 3,391 (54%) patients without PMRT. After the propensity score matching, 2,267 patients for each group were included in the analysis. The PMRT group showed significantly better overall survival and disease-free survival. Sensitivity analysis showed that pathology T2 stage and numbers of lymph node involved were statistically associated with poorer outcomes. Conclusion : Our study suggests that N1 breast cancer patients with PMRT have better overall survival and disease-free survival than those patients without PMRT after risk factors adjusted by the propensity score matching in the nationwide population-based study.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Radiotherapy plays an important role for cancer treatment. About 40% patients undergo palliative radiotherapy, which is usually emergent. How to shorten the proceeding time for radiotherapy is an important part to promote quality of medical service. We built a standard operation procedure to integrate the oncology information system for the emergent radiotherapy using Plan-Do-Check-Action (PDCA) management cycle. These procedures can shorten the waiting time of emergent radiotherapy and improve the quality of medical service. Materials and Methods : Twenty six patients underwent emergent radiotherapy from June 4, 2012 to June 29, 2012. According to the time-registry table before emergent radiotherapy, we checked the initial proceeding time of each patient for collecting pre-intervention data. Within duration of PDCA management cycle for improvement, fifty three patients were enrolled from August 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012. Proceeding time of each patient was also recorded after intervention. Result : The average waiting time between completion of CT simulation and starting of radiotherapy was 48.00 minute before the intervention. The time was reduced to 28.47 minute (p＜ 0.001) during intervention for improvement. Conclusion : Using PDCA management cycle can shorten the waiting time of emergent radiotherapy. It may let patients less unconformtable, keep schedule smoothing and effective before treatment, and avoid complain of patients and families due to waiting.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : In recent years, computed tomography scanners are widely used in the gel dosimeter for reading of the image information. However, the scanning parameter settings of computed tomography scanners will affect the image noise, thereby affecting the dose resolution. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the optimal scanning parameters of the CT scanner as the reading tool applied in NIPAM gel dosimeter to reduce the gel image noise, improve signal to noise ratio and increase availability of gel dosimeter in the clinical. Materials and Methods : Computer tomography scanner was applied to capture image in the gel dosimeter. Different scanning parameters were used to capture gel images. Scanning parameters changed independently from each other in order to evaluate the image noise affected by each individual parameter. Result : When the tube current was increased, the image noise would reduce. If the tube voltage was 80 kVp, 120 kVp, 140 kVp, and tube current increased from 100 mA to 230 mA, it can reduce the image noise to 59.3%, 64.1% and 60.7 %, respectively. In the same case, smaller image noise was obtained in the higher tube voltage. If the tube voltage was increased from 80 kVp to 140 kVp with 5 mm slice thickness, the noise can be reduced 52.4%. When the slice thickness was changed to 10 mm, the noise can be reduced 55.0%. Conclusion and Discussion : While the computer tomography scanner was used in the gel dosimeter for reading of the image information, the scanning parameters settings were needed to compromise for balancing and optimizing between tube head loading and the decreasing of the image noise. The tube voltage of 120 kVp and tube current of 200 mA are recommended for the optimizing settings by this study but the slice thickness is selected according to different conditions. Optimizing scanning parameter settings can reduce image noise affecting the interference resolution of the gel dosimeter in order to increase the accuracy of gel dosimeter in the clinical dose assessment.',\n",

       " 'Carcinosarcoma, a true malignant mixed tumor, is rarely seen in the parotid glands. The majority of cases arise from existing benign mixed tumors. Carcinosarcoma is considered an aggressive malignancy with a high probability of local recurrence and distant metastases. We report a case of carcinosarcoma arising from a parotid mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma) in a 56-year-old female. Initially, the disease presented as a progressively enlarged mass with local tenderness in the left parotid gland. Clinically, there were no symptoms or signs of facial nerve palsy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) performed at a different hospital revealed a tumor (4.1 × 3 × 2.5 cm) in the left parotid gland without any enlarged cervical lymphadenopathies. Subsequently, the patient underwent a left total parotidectomy with full preservation of the left facial nerve. The pathology report revealed carcinosarcoma arising from the mixed tumor.

       " 'Purpose: The primary goal of this study is to measure the systemic and random errors in prostatic cancer patients receiving definitive and adjuvant radiotherapy with cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT). The secondary aim is to evaluate the clinical factors that may affect these setup errors, and to determine the optimal planning target volume (PTV) margins for patients without using CBCT. Materials & Methods: From 2011 to 2015, we retrospectively reviewed 59 patients who underwent at least five sessions of definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy with CBCT. All the images were obtained prior to treatment. All the setup corrections were determined by physicians. The definitions of axis was X in left-right, Y in superior-inferior and Z in anterior-posterior. The overall mean error, systemic error (Σ) and random error (σ) were calculated for each axis. We used ANOVA and Student t-test models to evaluate the significance among various clinical factors and the setup errors. The optimal PTV margins without image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) were calculated based on Van Herk Formula. Results: In total, 1595 sets of images were obtained from this study. The mean error (mm), Σ (mm) and σ (mm) were 0.37, 1.92, 2.50 in X; 0.29, 1.33, 2.00 in Y; and 0.58, 1.59, 2.45 in Z axis, respectively. The median value of various clinical factors were 74 years of age, 165 cm in height, 69.1 kg in weight, BMI of 25.5 kg/m^2 and 45.9 ml of prostate volume. Other clinical factors such as clinical / pathological stage, definitive or adjuvant treatment and distension of rectum were also analyzed. The rectal distension affected the random error in direction Z significantly (p= 0.013). The optimal PTV margins without CBCT were 6.6, 4.7 and 5.7 mm in directions X, Y and Z, respectively. Conclusion: The dimensions of systemic and random errors in various axes were similar to previous studies. Rectal distension can influence anterior-posterior setup errors. The optimal PTV margins should be at least 4.7 ~ 6.6 mm to overcome the daily setup uncertainties without CBCT corrections.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Radiotherapy is recognized as an effective local treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, but limited evidence exists for its efficacy in repeat liver irradiation. When other treatment modalities have been exhausted, repeat irradiation may be the only option. A single institution experience of repeat irradiation of hepatocellular carcinoma is reported here. Materials and Methods: Between 2003 and 2013, 19 patients (M/F = 17/2; median age = 64.4 years) with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (8 in-field and 11 out-field) and having had previous radiotherapy, were treated with repeat irradiation. The primary eligibility criteria for selecting these patients for repeat liver irradiation was normal liver volume greater than 700 mL. The median equivalent dose in 2 Gy (EQD2) delivered to tumors was 47.5 Gy (range: 30-71 Gy). A proportion of patients had concurrent and maintenance angiogenic blockades. Univariate analyses were used to identify statistically significant prognostic factors. Results: Among the 19 patients, complete response was achieved in 4 patients, and partial response in 6. The median overall survival for the entire series was 10.3 months. Overall survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 47% and 26% respectively. The presence of either longer treatment intervals between radiotherapies (＞ 6.2 months) or use of angiogenic blockades was associated with longer overall survival on univariate analysis. The incidence of radiation induced liver injury was 11%. Conclusions: Repeat hepatic irradiation is possible where the necessary dosimetric parameters can be met. Patients with longer intervals between radiotherapies may achieve longer survival rates in comparison to those without. Survival benefit is attainable with concomitant and maintenance angiogenic blockades.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : This study aims at developing an immune-biosensor that can detect carcinoembryonic antigens (CEAs) in real time. Malignant tumors were the top cause of death in Taiwan in 2014. Among the GI tract cancer deaths, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer ranked third, seventh, and ninth. CEAs are the tumor biomarkers used when screening for human GI tract cancers. At present, immunoassays are the most widely used screening method. However, they are extremely time-consuming and require approximately 2-3 h per test. Thus, the present study is aimed at developing an immune-biosensor that can perform real-time CEA detection. Materials and Methods : Biosensor analysis technologies are fast becoming the preferred technology for analysis and screening in the 21st century. Such technologies operate by combining biometric materials, such as antibodies and enzymes, and various signal converters, such as microbalances or electrochemical electrodes. In the present study, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), with advantages of high stability, high sensitivity, real-time output, and reusability, was coated with polypropylene and equipped with a self-developed auto-sampling device to create a novel polypropylene-coated quartz crystal microbalance with auto-sampling (pQCM). The pQCM was then combined with CEA-related antibodies (high specificity and affinity to CEAs) to develop an immuno-biosensor that can instantaneously measure CEA concentrations, thereby creating an effective means to instantly screen for gastrointestinal cancers. Result : CEA-related monoclonal antibodies were adhered to the surface of the pQCM to create a CEA sensor. Four standard sample solutions were prepared by dissolving 0.2, 2.5, 25, and 200 ng/ml of CEA into phosphate buffered saline solution. The CEA sensor was then used to test the standard sample solutions. The samples with the lowest (0.5 ng/ml) and highest (200 ng/ml) CEA concentrations required only 5 and 10 min to complete testing, respectively. Tests were repeated 16 times over 8 days. Results indicated that the relative vibration frequency shift was maintained at 95% or higher, suggesting that the results achieved excellent operational stability. For comparison, samples prepared with 25 ng/ml of ferritin and α-fetoprotein only achieved a responsiveness of 3.9% and 4.6%, respectively. Subsequently, the test results of the 25 ng/ml CEA samples separately prepared with the 25 ng/ml of ferritin and α-fetoprotein showed an increase in responsiveness of only 6.5% compared to those of the pure 25 ng/ml CEA sample, confirming the excellent specificity of the proposed biosensor. Discussion : The proposed CEA sensor satisfies the requirements of the present study; in addition, the systems technology established in the present study can be applied to developing biosensors for multiple cancer biomarkers or even a cumulative and multifunctional cancer screening system, greatly benefiting the early identification of cancer.',\n",
       " \"Purpose : In order to reduce heart and ipsilateral lung dose, a modified TomoTherapy planning technique for left-sided breast was introduced and compared to Hybrid-IMRT technique. Materials and Methods: A modified TomoTherapy planning technique was designed for left-sided breast cancer patients. It was based on the Limited-TomoTherapy planning technique but applying optimal pitches to achieve better conformity and lower heart and ipsilateral lung dose. First, the optimized off-axis distance was determined. Then the optimal pitches were chosen according to the optimized off-axis distance. The last step was applying optimal pitches with the Limited- TomoTherapy planning technique, which employed several artificial contours such as the Complete-block, Directional-block for near PTV area and the virtual bolus, in the optimized process of the left-sided breast TomoTherpy planning. Hybrid-IMRT plans were designed by tangential-fields and IMRT fields combined. The prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions to PTV. The lung and heart dose volume were measured and analyzed in Beam's-eye-view of tangential-fields with in-field heart volume and in-field lung volume. Result: The maximum volumes of in-field heart volume and in-field lung volume were 15.49 cc and 88.8 cc, respectively. Comparing to the Hybrid-IMRT technique, the modified TomoTherapy planning technique increased the minimal dose of PTV (39.16±4.958 Gy vs. 30.56±9.478 Gy), the homogeneity index (HI= PTV_(m95%)-PTV_(m107%)) was better (0.9888 ± 0.0054 vs. 0.9690 ± 0.0138) and conformity index (CI= V_(95%)/PTV_(95%)) was no obvious difference (1.5892±0.2998 vs. 1.6286±0.2526). The D_(mean) of heart in modified planning technique was under 18.38% than in the Hybrid-IMRT technique (2.22 ± 1.872 Gy vs. 2.72 ± 2.214 Gy). The D_(mean) of Lt lung was under 13.74% in modified planning technique than in the Hybrid-IMRT technique (4.96 ± 1.352 Gy vs. 5.75 ± 0.848 Gy). Discussion and Conclusions: The modified planning technique showed better dose reduction in heart and lung, due to its more flexibility in the optimized planning process. It should be useful in left-sided breast treatment with TomoTherapy.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose : Image-guided radiation therapy is an important irradiating technique. To ensure the accuracy of image guidance, it is essential to conduct daily quality assurance (QA). According to Report No. 142 of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, we developed daily quality assurance for a two-dimensional image-guided system. This study reports our results and benefit analysis. Materials and Methods : Our image-guided linear accelerator was Varian Trilogy with On-Board Imager (OBI) system. The QA phantom was Isocenter Cube Assay (Varian TM55150000 isocenter Cube tool). A qualified radiation technologist executed 40 daily QAs for our two-dimensional image-guided system. QA items included collision interlocks, imaging and treatment coordinate coincidence and positioning tests. To ensure the correct position of the treatment couch, we performed three QA methods. First, we interpreted the displacement on a graph paper visually. Second, we identified the displacement of Ball Bullet (BB) on the center of the image-guided system by using orthogonal films (BB image analysis and detection). Third, we calculated the difference between BB and the intersection of laser lines (visual inspection of BB). We compared these three QA methods, including the time cost. Result : All collision interlocks tests had positive results. All imaging and treatment coordinates and positioning test results were within the range of allowable errors. Comparing the first two methods of position testing, no statistically significant difference was detected between them (P values in X-Y-Z three axes and total error, 0.229, 1, 0.867 and 0.196, respectively). Comparing the mean time taken for couch positioning among the three QA methods, the BB image analysis and detection took 0.4 seconds longer than the visual inspection of graph paper. The visual inspection of graph paper took 17.6 second longer than the visual inspection of BB. There was no statistically significant difference between the visual inspection of graph paper and BB image analysis and detection (P＞ 0.05). However, statistically significant differences were detected both (1) between the visual inspection of graph paper and the visual inspection of BB (P = 0.00012), and (2) between the BB image analysis and the visual inspection of BB (P = 0.00006). Conclusion : Our QA methods ensure the quality of two-dimensional image-guided radiation therapy in both Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) and OBI systems. The QA procedures are easy to implement. To ensure the accuracy of radiotherapy, establishing QA procedures for image-guided systems is strongly recommended.',\n",
       " \"Oral cancer, one common subtype of head and neck cancers in Taiwan, mainly presented as a locoregional disease at diagnosis. Even in its late course, distant metastasis is still rare. Previously, once cancer patients with distant metastasis - even in limited number or small size (i.e., oligometastasis) - were considered as having an ＂incurable＂ disease. Thus, palliative treatments were recommended. However, several lines of evidence showed that while applying aggressive managements, most oligometastatic cancer patients demonstrated a durable disease-free survival when compared with those patients with disseminated metastases. This observation implicated that oligometastasis may be a 'potentially curable,' rather than ＂incurable＂ disease status. This phenomenon has been observed in several types of cancers, such as colorectal cancer, melanoma, and endometrium cancer. But, few data were reported in oral cancer. Herein, we presented an oral cancer patient with an un-resectable pulmonary oligometastasis. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) was given in conjunction with Simultaneous Integrated Inner-Escalated Boost (SIEB) technique. Four months after SABR/SIEB, complete response was observed. Moreover, no evidence of cancer disease was noted in both lung and head-and-neck region till the last follow-up (two years after RT).\",\n",

The clinical manifestations of this tumor are generally painless without obvious symptoms or signs. The disease is tentatively diagnosed by imaging study, and is confirmed histologically. The main treatment for ameloblastoma is tumor resection with or without reconstruction surgery. The optimal treatment options for clinically inoperable disease or refusal of operation are not defined. Radiotherapy is able to increase the likelihood of local control. The 50-year-old patient visited our hospital due to painless mass over his anterior mandible. Histologic examination showed ameloblastoma. The patient refused operation.

       " 'Introduction : The purpose of this study is to evaluate preliminary outcomes in locally advanced rectal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Material and Method : From 2006 to 2013, 166 patients with newly diagnosed clinical stage II or III rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant CCRT were identified (cT2- 3=155, cT4=11, cN+=93). All of them received external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with median dose of 5040 cGy (4400 - 5400 cGy). The regimens of chemotherapy combined with radiation were Capecitabine (47%), Tegafur & Uracil (40%) and others. Median duration from the end of neoadjuvant CCRT to surgery was 56 days (21 - 173 days). All radical surgery were done in a total mesorectal excision (TME) fashion. The end points of this study included overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), pelvic recurrence-free survival (PRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). We also analyzed factors associated with pathological complete response (pCR) and outcomes between different surgical procedures. Result : After a median follow-up duration of 3.03 years (0.22 - 8.16 years), 5-year OS rate was 73%, 5-year CSS rate was 78%, median PRFS was 2.6 ± 2 years, and median DMFS was 2.2 ± 2 years. There were no differences in OS (p= .776) and CSS (p= .717) between patients receiving Capecitabine or Tegafur & Uracil combined with radiation. We achieved pCR rate of 11.45%, and ratio of receiving anal-preservation surgery was 77% (59%, 87%, 100% for lower third, middle third, and upper third tumor, respectively). In subgroup analysis, laparoscopic surgery group had lower pelvic recurrence rate (11.1% v.s 25.6%, p= .036), less intra-operative blood loss (mean, 174 cc v.s 309 cc, p= .012), and shorter hospital stay (mean, 8 days v.s 13 days, p= .000). The 5-year OS rate was 78% for laparoscopic surgery group and 59% for open surgery group respectively (p = .126), the 5-year CSS rate was 80% and 72% (p= .572), median PRFS was 2.2 years and 4.6 years (p= .672), and median DMFS was 2 years and 3.5 years (p= .549). Conclusion : Neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery is a feasible way to treat locally advanced rectal cancer, and the 5-year OS rate was 73% in the current study. Capecitabine and Tegafur & Uracil are reasonable choices as concurrent regimens. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended due to lower surgical morbidities and noninferiority of outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : The date of surgery or radiotherapy (RT) was not recorded in the National Health Insurance database until Jan. 1, 2011, which limits the calculation of the exact time interval between treatments. Our purpose is to formulate and validate a surrogate estimate for the time interval between surgery and adjuvant RT. Materials and Methods: Information of patients with malignant brain tumors diagnosed and treated with surgery and adjuvant RT between Jan. 1, 2011 and Dec. 31, 2012 was obtained from the National Health Insurance (NHI) database and retrospectively analyzed. The surrogate estimate for the interval between surgery and RT was formulated according to the date of outpatient visits and the first date of hospitalization. Surrogate estimate of the interval was validated with the exact interval calculated by the later coded dates of surgery and RT from the database, using the best-fitting linear regression. Results: 1,527 cases of malignant brain tumors were defined according to ICD-9 diagnosis code. 394 cases were excluded for the presence of other cancer diagnoses. Among the remaining 1,133 cases, 463 cases receiving both brain tumor excision and adjuvant RT were analyzed. Surrogate estimate of time intervals and exact time intervals correlate well with a slope of 1.0076, a y-intercept close to -1 day, and an R2 of 0.8633. The calculation is further improved to an R2 of 0.9809 with a slope of 0.9951 and a y-intercept close to 5 days, by excluding cases with surrogate estimates of an interval smaller or equal to 0. Conclusion: Our validated surrogate estimate of the interval between surgery and adjuvant RT provides a possible method to overcome the limitation of inadequate date information before Jan. 1, 2011, and therefore enables the application of most of the data from the Health and Welfare Database for research regarding the effect of RT delay on cancer outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : We developed a quality assurance protocol for treating painful bone metastasis with a Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) system. The system delivers ultrasonic energy to heat the MR-delineated metastatic bone target up to 60 degrees Celsius and ablate periosteal nerve fibers for sustained pain control. In this protocol, equipments, calibration procedures, and recommended tolerance are reported. Materials and Methods : In this research, we measured sonication-induced temperature change in a homogenous phantom before and after Daily Quality Assurance (DQA) procedure performed in thirty-one treatment sessions in a single institute. Distances between ultrasonic focus and the spot with highest temperature (Focusing Error, FE) in the phantom were measured with magnetic resonance thermography. Result : DQA procedure effectively decrease FE (Pre-DQA group: 1.73±0.43 mm, DQA group: 0.43±0.12 mm, p-value＜0.01). Discussion : A comprehensive DQA procedure decreases focusing error and therefore guarantees treatment accuracy. It may translate into better patient safety and avoid unplanned heating of adjacent critical structures. We recommend that a FE of less than 1 mm should be achieved with DQA procedure before starting a MRgFUS treatment session.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : This prospective study used the Computed Imaging Reference System (CIRS) phantom and Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) dosimeters to evaluate internal dose and surface dose differences between two different types of treatment plans in radiotherapy for breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods : In this study, we used MOSFET dosimeters as a measurement tool. To simulate the real breast cancer patients, we used CIRS phantom to make prosthesis. After CT simulation, images were transmitted to the Pinnacle planning system, and then field-in-field (FIF) and hybridintensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment plans were conducted. Irradiation through a linear accelerator to collect dose data by MOSFET dosimeters. The dose data calculated by the Pinnacle planning system were also collected. We compared the dosimetry differences between FIF and hybrid- IMRT techniques. Result : The mean measured surface dose from 1 to 20 points, in a single dose of prescription 180 cGy, was 142.8 ± 2.74 cGy and 136.3 ± 1.98 cGy for FIF and Hybrid-IMRT technique, respectively. The mean measured internal dose from 5 internal dose points was 202.3 ± 2.01 cGy and 194.3 ± 2.64 cGy for FIF and Hybrid-IMRT technique, respectively. On the other hand, treatment planning system revealed that the mean dose for FIF and Hybrid-IMRT technique was 195.5 ± 9.7 cGy and 187.6 ± 5.7 cGy, respectively. The V95 for FIF and Hybrid-IMRT technique was 97.5% and 97.9%, respectively. Normal lung tissue dose V5 for FIF and Hybrid-IMRT technique was 0.84% and 4.13%, respectively. The 110% volume of high-dose region for FIF and Hybrid-IMRT technique was 107 cm^3 and 0.8 cm^3, respectively. In addition, treatment planning system showed that the mean surface dose of 1 to 20 points was 117.1 ± 8.1 cGy and 113.5 ± 7.9 cGy for FIF and Hybrid-IMRT technique, respectively; the mean internal dose of five measurement points FIF dose was 202.3 ± 0.37 cGy and 189.7 ± 0.15 cGy for FIF and Hybrid-IMRT technique, respectively. Conclusions : Our study suggested that compared to FIF, Hybrid-IMRT technique can improve dose uniformity and decrease surface dose, and lower skin reactions can be expected. Furthermore, shorter time is required for Hybrid-IMRT plan, which is more efficient in terms of the program approach.',\n",

       " 'Purpose : Patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) undergoing surgery were recommended to receive adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy if there are unfavorable prognostic factors. Positive surgical margin and extracapsular extension (ECE) of lymph node were well-known major prognostic factors and adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was suggested for patients with these factors. However, the managements of patients with other risk factors were still debatable. In this study, we tried to recognize the minor risk factors and provide adjuvant treatment suggestions. Materials and Methods : From January 2002 to December 2013, 567 OSCC patients receiving radical surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Five-year locoregional control (LRC), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the risk factors for LRC, DFS, and OS. Cox regression model was used for multivariate analyses. Results : The median follow-up time was 3.5 years (range: 0.2–12.5 years). The median age of the patients was 54 years old (range 28 to 79 years). The 5-year OS rate for stage I, II, III, IVa, IVb patients were 79.7%, 70.8%, 65.8%, 49.0%, and 17.7%, respectively. The 5-year DFS rate for stage I, II, III, IVa, IVb patients were 65.8%, 63.8%, 61.5%, 39.9% and 30.1%, respectively. The 5-year LRC rate for stage I, II, III, IVa, IVb patients were 77.6%, 77.6%, 76%, 67.8% and 42.5%, respectively. The pathological T-classification, pathological N-classification, ECE, pathological tumor depth, lymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, histology grading were prognostic factors for 5-year LRC, DFS and OS. Moreover, age and treatment modalities were prognostic factors for 5-year OS and age, performance status, vascular invasion and treatment modalities were prognostic factors for 5-year DFS, respectively. In subgroup analysis, 203 patients with at least two of poor prognostic factors and without positive margin nor ECE receiving RT with radiation dose at least 60 Gy showed better 5-year LRC (76.2% v.s 68.6%, p= 0.027) and DFS (56.1% v.s 44.1%, p= 0.05) and OS (63.9% v.s 50.4%, p= 0.021) than those without adjuvant RT or receiving RT with radiation dose less than 60 Gy. Conclusions : In addition to ECE and positive margin, pathological T-classification T4a/T4b, pathological positive node, pathological tumor depth ≧ 10 mm, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, perineural invasion and poorly differentiated grading were poor prognostic factors for LRC and survival outcomes for OSCC patients. Patients with two or more poor prognostic factors should receive radiotherapy with radiation dose at least 60 Gy.',\n",

Material and Methods : We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with malignant gliomas who received postoperative radiotherapy in our department between April 2007 and October 2014. Clinical characteristics, surgical resection status, and image findings of these patients were reviewed and analyzed. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results : Thirty-four patients were included in the study. Thirteen patients (38%) were diagnosed with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 21 patients (62%) with glioblastoma (GBM). The median follow-up time was 14 months (range: 4–46 months). The median OS for all patients was 14.3 months (range: 3.8–45.7 months). The median OS of patients with AA and those with GBM were 15.2 and 12.3 months, respectively (p = 0.0355). In patients with GBM, group 1 (tumor resected more than 50%) had better OS than group 2 (tumor resected less than 50%, p = 0.0225). Conclusions : Our results showed similar OS to published articles. Surgical resection status was demonstrated to be an important prognostic factor for OS in patients with GBM.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To assess if the novel radiotherapy technique named interrupted deep inspiration with respiratory gating (IDIRG) modified from deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) can reduce left pulmonary and cardiac dose compared to traditional free breath method (FB) in left breast cancer patients needing nodal irradiation and not tolerating DIBH. Materials and Methods : Twelve postoperative left breast cancer patients needing nodal irradiation were evaluated. Five used IDIRG technique and seven used the traditional FB method. The IDIRG method differs most from FB technique during the CT-simulation phase. Patients were asked to take interrupted deep inspiration breaths monitored by the Varian Real-time Position Management Respiratory Gating System (RPM). Axial CT was applied instead of routinely used Helical CT. Target delineation included the whole left breast, left chest wall, and regional lymph nodes with or without internal mamillary nodes. Treatment planning was made using volumetric modulated arc technique. Result : There was no statistically significant difference in IDIRG and FB in respect to target volume (855.85 ml vs 836.83 ml, p= 0.740), target coverage (97.41% vs 96.99%, p =0.728), and hotspot (113.33% vs 114.42%, p= 0.128). In terms of left pulmonary and cardiac endpoints, IDIRG showed significantly larger total lung volume (3465.33ml vs 2065.14ml, p ＜0.001) which translated into a lesser, but not statistically significant, left pulmonary dose (V20: 27.92% vs 30.11%, p= 0.156; V10: 47.42% vs 51.08%, p= 0.199), and significant reduction in cardiac dose including heart (V25: 4.77% vs 17.09%, p= 0.012; mean dose: 10.78 Gy vs 15.71 Gy, p= 0.016) and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (D10: 31.80 Gy vs 50.41 Gy, p= 0.004; mean dose: 24.46 Gy vs 43.64 Gy, p＜ 0.001). Conclusions : IDIRG, a novel radiotherapy technique designed for patients with left breast cancer needing nodal irradiation and not tolerating DIBH, can provide expanded lung volume to reduce cardiac dose, corresponding to lower long-term cardiac mortality compared to the traditional FB method.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Based on the ＂medical radiation exposure quality assurance standards＂, with on-site visits to the radiation therapy departments, a national database for the accuracy and quality control of dosimetry in radiotherapy were established. This database can serve as a basis for reviewing the effects of the quality assurance standards for medical radiation exposure and improving quality assurance policies related to medical radiation exposure. In addition, the database can serve as a reference for clinical units seeking to enhance the quality of technologies used in radiotherapy and to strengthen the integrity of quality assurance measures related to medical radiation exposure.

Methods of QA procedure, equipments of dose calibration will be ask to provide for on site inspection. Site visits will give a more detailed understanding of the actual situation of all quality assurance operations, and for dose output, beam energy and beam flatness and symmetry, actual measurement will be performed on site. Analyze the QA data from this study, including treatment equipment characteristics, characteristics of dose measurement instruments, the variations from the dose calibration methods, medical units and personnel statuses which will be an important reference for the improving of quality assurance in radiation therapy. Results : after data survey and parameter corrections, the results of on-site check for the QA items executed in this study are all fit the criteria of the ＂radiation exposure of medical quality assurance standards＂ Discussion : To improve the quality assurance procedures, we offer the following recommendations: 1. phantom dose conversion factor should be established, if the phantom is not used in the protocol, hence to further enhance the accuracy of dose calibration; 2. an appropriate reference level of beam flatness and symmetry should be established for monitoring the beam quality more effectively. 3. beam flatness and symmetry shall be calculated using the same formula list in the AEC published program of ＂radiation exposure of medical quality assurance standards＂. 4. the calibration criteria of brachytherapy source activity should be revised. 5. the data worksheet of dose calibration should be established fully according to the enclosed data worksheet in the protocol, should avoid direct or sole use of excel application tools.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : The purpose of the Rounded Leaf Offset (RLO) table was to take into account the differences between planning leaf positions and actual radiation leaf edges. Most users utilize the default RLO table supplied by the vendor. Our goal was to improve the dosimetric accuracy in Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) by applying the measured RLO parameters. Materials and Methods : This study consists of two parts: (1)The radiation leaf edges at various positions were measured with ion chamber dosimetry system. The results were compared with the default table in the Treatment Planning System (TPS). (2) Five VMAT clinical plans were used to evaluate the overall dosimetric effects of RLO table. An ion chamber in a solid water phantom was used to determine the absolute dose at a reference point for each plan. The 2D dose distributions were measured with a 2D-Array dosimetry system. Results : The RLO measurements showed that the offsets were between -0.205 mm and 0.658 mm when the leaf positions crossed the central axis of the beam. The differences between the default and measured RLO values were less than 1 mm when the leaf positions were in the range of -8 cm and 0 cm, but at -10 cm position the difference was 1.6 mm. At the central beam axis, the measured correction was 0.538 mm and the others were in range of 0.655 mm and -1.061 mm for the leaf positions at 2 cm to 18 cm. After the modification of RLO table, the TPS calculated doses for the VMAT plans were lower than those calculated with default RLO table. Also, based on the measurements of 5 VMAT plans, the point doses improved about 1.6% to 3.4%, and the 2D dose distributions using 3% / 3 mm Gamma test achieved 94.4% to 98.2% passing rate. Conclusions : This study established the RLO correction values in our department. We found the default RLO values are obviously inaccurate for our machine. This adjustment of RLO table improves the dose calculation accuracy of TPS, in the meantime, ensures the quality of patients’treatments.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Pencil Beam Convolution (PBC) and Analytical Anisotropic Algorithm (AAA) were used to calculate the surface dose of simulated phantoms for head-and-neck patients treated with intensitymodulated radiation therapy. These were also used to evaluate the reliability of calculated results for the skin dose in vivo head-and-neck patients. Materials and Methods : This experiment adopted 0.1 mm ultrathin thermoluminescent dosimeters (ultrathin TLD) and ISP Gafchromic EBT2 film as measurement tools. The surface doses at hypothetical neck lymphatic regions were measured. Seven-field IMRT plans with a prescribed dose of 180 cGy were designed using an Eclipse (version10.0) treatment planning system where both PBC and AAA were implemented. These two different measurement tools were used to measure the absolute dose when calculated algorithms used different grid sizes. Result : In this experiment the variance coefficient of ultrathin TLD was within 3%. The reading values and delivered doses were in a good linear relationship. The points on calibration curve of Gafchromic film were within 1%. Using grid size of 2.5 mm, the errors between calculated values (PBC and AAA) and the mean surface measured doses for EBT2 film and ultrathin TLD were 13.02%, 10.73% and -4.54%, -6.48% on right side and -12.52%, -10.06% and -4.58%, -1.9% on left side neck of IMRT head/neck phantom, respectively. The errors between calculated values (PBC and AAA) and the mean surface measured doses for EBT2 film and ultrathin TLD were -0.99%, -2.26% and 0.64%, -0.64% on right side and -7.68%, -12.47% and 2.9%, -2.44% on left side neck of anthropomorphic Rando® phantom, respectively. Thus, AAA had more stable calculated results and performance than PBC using a grid size of 2.5 mm. Conclusion and Discussion : From the experimental results, neither algorithm was precise in calculating the surface dose. However, AAA was closer to the measured dose and its performance was stable. Future research will evaluate the most precise algorithm and modify the contours of the body to evaluate the skin dose. The treatment planning system can then be used directly to calculate patients’ skin dose indeed affecting the skin reaction.',\n",
       " 'The triad of colonic polyposis, mesenchymal tumors of the skin or soft tissues, and osteomas, is known as Gardner syndrome (GS). This syndrome is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait that occurs in approximately half of the children of afflicted parents. GS is the variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and shares the same genetic disorder as FAP. The fact that GS is associated with extra-colonic manifestations may be the result of a variable penetrance of a common genetic mutation. GS may present osteomas of the bones, sebaceous or epidermoid cysts, fibromas, neurofibromas, lipomas, pigmented skin lesions, or fibromatosis. The deep fibromatosis is most commonly referred to as a desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis in the literature, and appears in only approximately 3-5% of affected individuals with GS. Treatment of fibromatosis is indicated only when it causes clinical symptoms, dysfunction of adjacent structures, or aesthetic concerns. Surgical excision is generally advised first; however, there may be local recurrence even following a wide resection. Local radiotherapy could be used in un-resectable or recurrent fibromatosis for symptoms alleviation. We present two rare cases of GS in a family with recurrent fibromatosis after repeated excision. The tumor caused clinical symptoms, affected daily life and had negative aesthetic effects. A 50-54 Gy radiation dose in 1.8-2 Gy fractions was delivered to the involved tumor region in a 5-6 week course. Fibromatosis responded to radiotherapy, and the tumor regressed during serial follow-ups for more than a year. Radiation therapy achieved satisfactory results in local control and cosmetic outcome. The pain and disfiguration could all be ameliorated. Treatment was well tolerated, with only Grade 1 radiation dermatitis, mucositis, and xerostomia using the acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Our results support that radiotherapy could be used as salvage therapy for such recurrent benign tumors.',\n",

However, there were no randomized trials for post-operative chemoradiotherapy in patients with close margin due to its low incidence. Here, we present a 52-year-old female adenoid cystic carcinoma patient with a history of right breast mucinous carcinoma. After primary surgical resection, the patient received adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy due to positive margin. Radiotherapy 60 Gy together with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m^2 were delivered within six weeks. The patient was followed at our outpatient clinic for 1 more year after the initial surgery. No severe complications were found except for a persistant weak voice due to left vocal cord palsy. The patient's phonation improved after intracordal hyaluronic acid injection. We concluded that postoperative adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) may be a good treatment modality for tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma.\",\n",
       " 'Background and purpose : Betel nut chewing is associated with oral cavity cancer in Taiwan. Radiotherapy is one of the therapeutic approaches. Our previous study demonstrated that microRNA (miR)-17-5p (one of the miR-17-92 polycistronic miRNAs) was enhanced in the irradiated OC3 cancer cell line (which was established from oral squamous cell carcinoma in a long-term betel nut chewer who did not smoke), and miR-17-5p was also found to inhibit downstream protein p21 expression and induce radiosensitivity. In this study, we used a human apoptosis protein array to clarify which apoptosis-related proteins are modulated by miR-17-5p. Materials and Methods : Total cell lysates from OC3 cells with control small interfering (si)RNA or miR-17-5p were used to analyze apoptosis-related proteins. A specific miR- 17-5p effector apoptosis-related protein was confirmed by Western blotting. To confirm the role of p53 in irradiated OC-3 cells, OC3 cells without or with a p53-overexpressing clone were irradiated and examined by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Results : Using a human apoptosis protein array analysis (R&D Systems; catalog # ARY009), we simultaneously detected the relative expressions of 35 apoptosis-related proteins in OC3 cells that were treated with an miR-17-5p antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN) or a control ODN. Several proteins, including p21, p53, TNF RI, FADD, cIAP-1, HIF-1α, and TRAIL R1, were found to be up- or downregulated by miR-17-5p in OC3 cells; their expression patterns were also confirmed by Western blotting. We further clarified the role of p53 in irradiated OC3 cells, using a p53 overexpression strategy, and results revealed that enhancement of p53 expression significantly enhanced radiation-induced G2/M arrest of OC3 cells. Conclusions : miR-17-5p regulated the apoptosis-related proteins of p21, p53, TNF RI, FADD, cIAP-1, HIF-1α, and TRAIL R1 in OC3 cells; interestingly, its effect on p53 protein expression contributed to modulating the cell cycle arrest of OC3 cells.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To evaluate the role of radiotherapy in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with inferior vena cava tumor thrombosis (IVCTT) and the prognostic factors for overall survival. Materials and Methods : Twenty-two patients with HCC and IVCTT referred for radiotherapy between 2006 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions was delivered with intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques. Patient-related and treatment-related factors were analyzed to evaluate their prognostic significance for overall survival rate. Results : Complete response was noted in 7 patients and partial response in 6 patients. The 1-year, 2-year overall survival rates were 40.9 %, 22.7% and the median survival was 8 months for the entire cohort of patients. Objective response (complete or partial response) to radiotherapy was the only prognostic factor for overall survival. For patients with objective response to radiotherapy, the median survival was 16.9 months and the 1-year overall survival rate was 53.8%, compared to 4.7 months and 22.2% of those without objective response (p =0.004). Conclusions : Our results showed that radiotherapy achieved a high objective response rate and prolonged survival in patients with HCC and IVCTT. Patients with response to radiotherapy have favorable prognosis than their counterpart. Radiotherapy could be considered as an effective palliative treatment option for patients with HCC and IVCTT.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the preliminary outcome of curative image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) with Helical Tomotherapy or RapidArc for patients with intermediate- to highrisk prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Between April 2008 and October 2012, 72 patients with pathologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma were included. Age ranged from 58 to 89 with mean age of 73 years. Twenty-three patients were intermediate-risk group and 49 were high-risk group. Fifty-one and 21 patients were treated with Helical Tomotherapy and RapidArc respectively. The mean radiation dose was 74 Gy. Twenty patients were treated with external beam radiation therapy alone (EBRT-only group) and 52 were treated with EBRT plus androgen deprivation therapy (EBRT-ADT group). The biochemical failure was defined by a rise of 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir prostate specific antigen (PSA). The nadir was defined as lowest PSA value preceding a given threshold of 0.2 ng/mL or as absolutely lowest PSA before the transient bounce. Toxicities were assessed and documented in agreement with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3 (CTCAE v.3.0). Results: With the mean follow-up period of 28 months, four patients (5%, 4/72) had biochemical failure. The mean time interval to achieve the nadir PSA (TnPSA) in the EBRT-only group and EBRT-ADT group were 15.58 months and 5.73 months respectively (p = 0.001). All patients tolerated IGRT without any interruption. The patients exhibited grades 1 and 2 levels of acute genitourinary toxicities at 59.7% (43/72) and 5.6% (4/72). Grade 1 acute gastrointestinal toxicity was 34.7% (25/72). As for late toxicity, two patients developed grade 2 radiation proctitis 20 months after EBRT. Conclusion : IGRT for patients with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer was an effective and well-tolerated treatment. The EBRT-ADT group had better biochemical control than the EBRT-only group. Longer follow-up period was necessary.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) was suggested to improve outcomes and reduce toxicity for localized prostate cancer treatment. We generated virtual treatment plans to evaluate the dosimetric impacts with and without IGRT. Materials and Methods: Daily position setup errors from 10 patients treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) were acquired with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). A margin of 5 mm was added to the clinical target volume (CTV) to generate a planned target volume (PTV). We shifted the isocenters in the planning system with errors, fraction by fraction, to simulate the situation without IGRT. Dosimetric indices were compared between the initial plans (pretreatment CT plans) and the shifted plans. Radiobiological evaluations of an equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were also performed. Results : The system errors (Σ) and random errors (σ) in the left-right (LR), superiorinferior (SI), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions were Σ LR=1.4 mm, σ LR= 1.95 mm, Σ SI =3.22 mm, σ SI = 2.46 mm, Σ AP=3.17 mm and σ AP = 2.79 mm. Coverage of the CTV for 100% and 95% of the prescribed doses were lower in the shifted plans (V100%: 99.99% vs. 92.37%, p ＜ 0.05 and V95%: 100% vs. 99.46%, p ＜ 0.05). There was no difference in the dosimetric indices for the bladder and rectum. The EUD value of the CTV was also lower in the shifted plan (76.8 Gy vs. 75.4 Gy, p ＜ 0.05). The EUD and NTCP for the bladder and rectum did not statistically differ. Conclusions: Using CBCT-acquired VMAT for treating prostate cancer not only shortened the treatment time but also decreased the setup uncertainty. In the setting of reducing the PTV margin to 5 mm, the dose to the prostate was compromised without IGRT but the estimated toxicity to the rectum and bladder exhibited no difference.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Evaluation of NIPAM gel dosimeter under respiratory motion to verify radiotherapy treatment plan. Materials and Methods: We used a self-designed NIPAM gel dosimeter and a set of NIPAM gel calibration tubes to perform the experiment. The calibration tubes and gel dosimeter were set on a movable device which simulated respiratory movement of the chest. The movement parameters of the calibration tubes and the gel dosimeter were: ±10 mm cephalic and caudal displacement (20 mm in total), and a period of 4 seconds. Correction and gel dosimeter before irradiation CT images were taken by CT simulator. The calibration tube was made by filling NIPAM gel into a test tube. For each calibration tube, a specific radiation dose of 0,1, 2, 5, 8,10 Gy (6 MV photon) was given respectively by a Varian iX Linear accelerator. MRI scan was then performed to each calibration tube after irradiation and the T2 value obtained was converted to R2 value before a calibration curve was plotted. Another cylinder was also filled with NIPAM gel. A treatment plan of bilateral tangential forward field-in-field IMRT was done by Varian Eclipse planning system. The gel dosimeter was then irradiated up to 5.4 Gy (6 MV photon) with Varian iX linear accelerator using the treatment plan generated by the treatment planning system. A MRI scan was then performed, and the image data was than analyzed with MATLAB to evaluate dose curve change between the treatment plan and the gel dosimeter. Results: The sensitivity of the calibration gel dosimeter was 0.1353 s^(-1)/Gy. The correlation coefficient (R^2) of the calibration curve was 0.9952. In axial sections, when comparing dose distribution of the treatment plan and the gel dosimeter, 70% and 80% isodose curves were in high concordance. In sagittal and coronal views, the area of low dose region (＜ 60% isodose curves) in the gel dosimeter was larger than that of the treatment plan. In addition, the area of high dose region in the treatment plan was larger than that of the gel dosimeter. Conclusion: We demonstrated three-dimensional dose distribution of the NIPAM gel dosimeter with respiratory motion, had high concordance with that of the calculated treatment plan. Therefore using NIPAM gel dosimeter to verify radiotherapy treatment plan with respiratory motion is feasible.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop a web application programming interface to integrate records and verify systems of various vendors and help bridging hospital information system and electronic radiotherapy medical record. Materials and Methods: The structure and fields of three commercial records and verify systems were identified and studied. A web application programming interface was implemented to perform the following three tasks: 1. Pre-defined fields were queried from each database using PHP and standard SQL language, 2. The retrieved data were rearranged and consolidated to fulfill clinical needs, 3. The patients' treatment histories were summarized and exported to hospital information system via JSON format. The performance of the web API, commercial applications, and with manual transfer of paper charts were measured by analysis of query time for twenty patients. Results: The system has been transparently incorporated into our radiation treatment planning workflow. The website-based database interface has allowed authorized users with minimal training to extract patient's daily treatment from the database anytime and anywhere in the hospital. The query time significantly decreased using this system. Conclusions : The web application programming interface can integrate patient's treatment data from different commercial treatment machines and export to hospital information system. The application breakthrough the vendor's limitation, and is helpful in developing radiotherapy electronic medical records.

       " 'Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant neoplasm with a poor survival worldwide. In the 2012 cancer registration report showed a prevalence rate about 7.5% of all hepatobiliary malignancy in Taiwan whereas it was 10 - 15% in the world. The overall 5-year survival rate is only 20 - 30% in literature. Surgical resection is the mainstay treatment for operable patients. However, complete microscopic (R0) resection is difficult to achieve due to the complicated distribution of vessel network and close surrounding normal organs. Thus, the role of post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy is important but normal tissue radiation tolerance remains a critical issue. By using intraoperative radiaotherapy (IORT), the target lesion could be irradiated with single high-dose fraction while avoiding surrounding tissues. Here, we presented a 78-year-old male with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma without regional lymphadenopathy. IORT with 20 Gy via a portable kilovoltage x-ray generator was delivered in operative room after removal of tumor and surrounding tissues. The pathology report showed close surgical margin and no regional lymph node metastasis. No further adjuvant external beam radiotherapy or chemotherapy was given due to none of major risk factor and old age. After 6-month follow up, no evidence of recurrence and complication was noted. We conclude that IORT might be a safe radiotherapy modality for patients with resectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The long term follow up for evaluation of late toxicity and treatment outcome is warranted.',\n",
       " 'Background : Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is a rare malignant tumor of the uterus. Few extrauterine ESS cases arising in vagina and pelvic cavity were reported. The main treatment for extrauterine ESS is surgical resection; however the role of radiotherapy in extrauterine ESS remained unclear. We aimed to explore the value of radiotherapy treating low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS), especially in extrauterine. We presented one case of extrauterine LGESS arising in vaginal wall with surgical treatment and adjuvant radiotherapy and the second case arising from pelvic cavity treated with tumor-directed radiotherapy alone. Case Presentation : Case 1: A 39-year-old woman presented with symptom of excessive vaginal bleeding. A polyp tumor protruding from the vagina wall near cervical os was found on speculum examination. She underwent surgical removal of the mass. The microscopic examination revealed LGESS. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed using external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions and brachytherapy with a dose of 3 Gy x 2 fractions. Case 2: A 59-year-old woman had a past history of abdominal total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to intramural leiomyoma at age 45 years. She presented with progressive lower abdominal pain and anuria for days. Contrast-enhanced CT scan showed a 8x5 cm soft tissue mass over left pelvic cavity close to trigone of urinary bladder and left ureter, with involvement of vaginal vault apex. Biopsy revealed LGESS. She received tumor-directed radiotherapy with a dose of 72 Gy in 40 fractions without surgical resection. Conclusions: Radiotherapy provide lower recurrence rate, but the result of overall survival was still in controversy. It can be considered in patients who are unsuitable for surgical resection. Our 2 cases had no evidence of recurrence in 1 year and 12 years of follows-up. Because of the paucity of extrauterine ESS, further investigation is needed to determine the benefit of radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To report the treatment outcome of the adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the respiratory tract. Materials and Methods: Twelve ACC patients diagnosed between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical resection and radiotherapy status were obtained from medical records. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: There was no statistical difference in OS (p=0.177) and PFS (p=0.264) of the upper and lower airway ACCs. However, there was a significantly better OS (p=0.005) and PFS (p=0.016) in patients that received surgical excision. Conclusions: The primary site does not affect the prognosis of ACCs. Surgical intervention plays a critical role in the management of ACCs.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The intent of this study was to compare the dosimetry of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and organs at risk (OARs) in left breast cancer patients in two treatment techniques, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and 3-dimentional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients with left breast cancer who had received post-operative radiotherapy (RT) to the breast between October 2012 and November 2013 were enrolled in the study. All patients were irradiated with 6- or 10-MV photon beams using 3-dimentional conformal tangential technique to the left whole breast. For dosimetric comparison, two sets of six-field IMRT plans, with or without LAD constraint of V20 Gy＜50%, on each patient were performed. These three RT plans were named tangential field (TF), non-LAD constraint (NLC) and LAD constraint (LC), respectively. Five patients also received supraclavicular fossa (SCF) irradiation, but only whole breast dosimetry parameters were analyzed. The conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI) and dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the LAD, heart and ipsilateral lung were calculated for analysis. Repeated measures of one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test (software SPSS 21.0) was used for statistics. Results: For the 14 patients given left breast irradiation, there was an obvious statistical benefit for HI (average 12.67%) and CI (average 92.95%) by IMRT (both p＜0.0001). According to the data, it was found that an LAD mean dose (Dmean), V20 Gy, V30 Gy and LAD area mean dose (LAD of 10 mm in all directions) were reduced by using the LC arm (average 20.28 Gy, 41.19%, 29.60% and 21.46 Gy, respectively) if using IMRT technique (all p＜0.05). However, there was no statistical difference between TF and LC arms (p＞0.05). Additionally, although the low dose bath (LAD V5 Gy average 82.81%) was a drawback in IMRT (p＜0.05), the LC arm was still better than the NLC arm if the LAD constraint was used (p=0.013). There was no statistical significance between the 3 arms in regard to LAD maximum dose (Dmax) (3-arm average 47.21 Gy). 3DCRT had lower heart Dmean (average 3.77 Gy), ipsilateral lung Dmean (average 7.14 Gy) and V5 Gy (average 19.21%) than with IMRT (average 6.10 Gy, 9.31 Gy and 38.57%, respectively) (all p＜0.0001), and there was no statistical difference between IMRT arms (p＞0.05). Conclusion: In the light of our dosimetric data, IMRT may offer much better HI and CI than conventional tangential-field RT. In order to decrease the high-dose area of LAD, we had to select an appropriate LAD constraint (in this study, LAD V20 Gy ＜50% was used), if IMRT planning was done. IMRT technique results in a low dose bath (V5 Gy) and we should use this treatment option carefully. Further investigation for LAD constraint is needed.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: We report the results of non-metastatic prostate cancer patients treated by helical tomotherapy (HT) in a single institution. Materials and Methods: From December 2006 to June 2013, eighty-five prostate cancer patients receiving image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) with HT were enrolled in this study. Mega-voltage computed tomography was performed to minimize geographic miss and setup error. The Phoenix definition was used to define biochemical failure. Toxicities were recorded based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Results: The median follow-up interval was 41 months (range, 8-96 months). The median radiation dose delivered was 76 Gy to the whole prostate. Fifty-four percent of patients were in the high-risk category. The 4-year biochemical control rate was 93.3%. All of the patients attributed to the low- and intermediate-risk groups had good biochemical control (n=39). For high-risk group, only 13% (6/46) patients had biochemical failure, and 2 of them also developed bony metastases. During treatment, only 4.7% and 9.4% of the patients experienced grade 2 acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity was observed. The cumulative incidence of late toxicities of grade 2 or above hemorrhagic proctitis, hemorrhagic cystitis and urethral stricture were 8.2%, 4.7% and 4.7%, respectively. Conclusion: For prostate cancer patients, IGRT with HT results an excellent biochemical control in our limited follow-up period. The treatment-related toxicities were acceptable.',\n",
       " 'Background and Purpose: We develop an in-house program to correct computed tomography (CT) numbers of cone beam CT (CBCT) images and to recalculate modified CBCT images by using treatment planning system (TPS) software to evaluate actual patient doses. Material and Methods: Mean CT numbers were determined for planning CT and CBCT for the same selected regions of air, tissue, and bone. Based on CT-density tables for the planning CT, the density of CBCT could be determined for a selected volume. After generating linear regression equations for both the CT-density table and the CBCT-density table, the CT numbers for CBCT could be modified to fit the planning CT-density table. The field of view (FOV) boundaries in the corrected CBCT images were identified and merged with the planning CT images to provide real scatter and attenuation data. Images of 2 phantoms and 12 patients were used to verify the accuracy of corrected CBCT doses. Results: Based on Pinnacle TPS calculations, the differences in point dose between CBCT and CT images in the phantom study were 0.71% (SD=1.73%) at 6 MV, and 0.49% (SD=1.39%) at 10 MV. The 2D passing rates for a gamma index were 97.46% (SD=4.08%) at 6 MV, and 99.32% (SD=0.90%) at 10 MV. The dose difference of D95% was 0.48%±1.19%. The difference in planning target volume (PTV) coverage of the prescribed dose was 0.36%±1.69%, and the 2D passing rate without threshold was 98.06%±1.66%. Conclusion: Patient-specific correction of daily CBCT images can be used for reconstructing daily dose distribution and is practicable for radiotherapy treatment and clinical evaluations.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: RapidArc is the latest VMAT technique of radiotherapy delivery, varying multi-leaves collimator (MLC) shape, dose rate and gantry speed simultaneously during gantry rotation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the interplay of dose rate setting and gantry speed during RapidArc optimization, and analyzing treatment planning and plan verify results to find out the most suitable dose rate setting. Materials and Methods: Thirteen patients included three head and neck, five esophageal and prostate patients were selected to re-optimize the treatment plan of RapidArc by setting six different dose rate (100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 MU/min). All re-optimized plans used the same dose constraint and priority for planned target volume and critical organ. Compare the results of the homogeneity index (HI) and conformal index (CI) in the tumor, the dose received by critical organs, monitor unit numbers, delivery time and plan verified by setting different dose rate. Result: All plans results showed that there was no evidence and trend toward improved plan quality for clinical case was observed with any dose rate. When setting high dose rate, gantry maximal speed was the main consideration then it was more flexible in modulating gantry speed and dose rate and using more arcs in plan also did. The main advantage of setting high dose rate was saving total treatment time. But not mean that it must be setting the maximum dose rate (600 MU/min). Conclusion: RapidArc plan was complex and limited by amounts of cases in this study, but high dose rate had high dynamic range in gantry speed modulation. No doubt high dose rate could reduce total treatment time.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Electronic medical records (EMR) have become indispensable. However, most medical records systems for radiation oncology in Taiwan are independent from hospital information systems (HIS), or asynchronous with HIS. It is difficult to gather information on radiation oncology for other members of cancer treatment team. Therefore, the aim of this study is to build an EMR system, which integrates with both HIS and the cancer registry database, to achieve efficient, safe, instant transfer of information. Materials & Methods: The needs of radiation oncology medical records, the existing processes, and the functions of the cancer registry system were identified first. By applying Java and web technology under J2EE architecture, we developed an electronic medical records system. Considering the characteristics of information storage and the need for future statistical analysis, we defined the information in the notes as different forms. We built a web-based version of the cancer registry system integrated with HIS, using the concept of reverse engineering. The data from the previous cancer registry system was imported and converted to be compatible with the new system to achieve the goal of online operation and real-time search. Results: The electronic medical records system included initial notes, acute radiation morbidity records, brachytherapy notes, complete notes, and a cancer registry database. By integrating with the HIS and sharing the information, we can reduce the time and possible mistakes clinicians spend on medical records and repeated inputing. The instant transparency for other members of the cancer treatment team are improved by the system as well. Conclusions: The electronic medical records designed by this study not only reduce documentation time, but also build a database containing complete patient history and other cancer information for retrospective study or clinical trial. It is also more flexible in response to changes in medical records policy.',\n",
       " 'Background: Hemangioma is the most common benign liver tumor, and mostly asymptomatic. For symptomatic hemangioma, surgical resection is the most common treatment. In unresectable hemangiomas, one of the alternative managements is radiotherapy, a relatively uncommon choice compared to transcatheter arterial embolization. We present our experience of four cases of liver hemangioma treated with fractionated radiotherapy and reviewed the literatures. Case Presentation: A total of four female patients, aged between 50 to 61 years, were retrospectively analyzed. They presented with symptoms of right upper quadrant pain and abdominal fullness. One patient had recurrent liver hemangioma years after liver resection. The other three received transcatheter arterial embolization to hemangioma with limited improvement in symptoms. All patients received radiotherapy with a total dose of 50-59.4 Gy in 20-33 fractions over a 4-7 week period. At the latest follow-up, the regression rate for these liver hemangiomas was 80.8% to 98.0% without radiation-associated adverse effects and the patients remained symptom-free. Conclusions: Radiotherapy is a feasible treatment for symptomatic liver hemangioma with good outcome.',\n",

The patient was treated with Helical Tomo-Therapy at a total dose of 50 Gy given in 2 Gy per fraction per day. Skin metastases in this case showed only partial response to radiotherapy, and new metastatic lesions developed during the treatment. Radiotherapy might be considered as a palliative treatment option for the skin metastasis of breast cancer. The treatment course of this case is described and previous reports are reviewed in this article.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To investigate the potential value of concurrent chemotherapy in patients with salivary gland carcinomas treated with postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). Materials and Methods: This retrospective review included 167 consecutive patients with major and minor salivary gland carcinomas from 2001 to 2011. All were treated with curative surgery followed by PORT (n=93) or postoperative chemoradiotherapy (POCRT) (n=74). The median cumulative radiation doses were 66 Gy for both groups, and cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapies were the most commonly used regimens. Results: The median follow-up was 5.4 years for survivors. Although patients receiving POCRT possessed more adverse pathological prognosticators and higher cancer stages, there were no statistical differences in locoregional control (LRC), diseasefree survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) between the PORT and POCRT groups according to early or advanced stage. However, a trend towards LRC improvement was observed in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) undergoing POCRT, with 100% 5-year LRC compared with 81% for those treated with PORT (P=.057). In subgroup analyses, POCRT provided significant LRC advantages over PORT for ACC patients who also exhibited positive surgical margins (P=.022) or perineural invasion (P=.043). The predominant pattern of failure for the entire cohort was distant metastasis. Conclusions: Adding concurrent chemotherapy to postoperative radiotherapy might be most beneficial in terms of LRC for salivary gland ACC patients with positive surgical margins or perineural invasion. Distant metastasis remains problematic despite multimodal intervention.',\n",
       " 'Objective: To evaluate tumor control, hearing preservation, and complication rates after frameless fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) in patients with acoustic neuromas (ANs). Methods: Fifty-seven patients with 63 ANs treated with FSRS at Chi-Mei Medical Center from 2009 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The radiation dose ranged from 18 Gy to 30 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions. To evaluate local control rate, we arranged brain MRI with contrast enhancement at regular intervals. Hearing ability was also assessed using the Gardner-Robertson scale. Additionally, subjective change of hearing was rated at regular OPD follow-ups. Results: With a median follow-up of 29.1 months (range 3.6-54.1), actuarial local control rate was 94.8% after 2 years and 89.3% after 3 years. Of the 13 patients with serviceable hearing and with audiograms, the hearing preservation rate was 88.2% at a median follow-up of 30.8 months. Among the 57 treated patients, 6 developed complications including grade 3 to 4 hydrocephalus, perifocal edema, and headache that needed medical or surgical intervention after treatment. Conclusion: Frameless fractionated SRS treatment of AN demonstrates good results for tumor control, hearing preservation rate, and acceptable rates of radiation related toxicity as compared to literature on study series on surgery, conventional stereotactic radiotherapy, and Gamma-knife based stereotactic radiosurgery, yet longer follow-up will be needed.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Surgery remains the primary treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, with concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) reserved for adjuvant treatment or as primary treatment for unresectable disease. However, the experience has been limited to flourauracilbased chemoradiation. A retrospective analysis of gemcitabine based CCRT as primary treatment for loco-regional cholangiocarcinoma in our institute was performed. Materials and Methods: Between April, 2004 and December, 2012, 26 patients (M/F=17/9; median age=66years) with cholangiocarcinoma (14 intrahepatic primary and 12 perihilar or extrahepatic primary) were treated with curative intent at our department. Baseline performance status based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) was 0-1 in 22 patients and 2 in 4 patients. Nine had regional extension of the diseases (defined as metastasis in either regional or para-aortic lymph nodes), whereas 17 had localized (T1-4N0M0) disease. The median equivalent dose in 2 Gy (EQD2) was 52.0 Gy (range: 40-72.1 Gy). Concurrent chemotherapy was low dose gemcitabine at 400 mg/m2 given weekly to biweekly. Both univariateand multivariate analyses were used to identify statistically significant prognostic factors. Results: The median survival of the entire cohort was 13.2 months. Survival rates at 1 and 2 year were 53% and 8% respectively. Patients of better performance status (ECOG 0-1) had improved median survival in comparison to those who of poorer baseline performance status (ECOG 2) (16.9 months vs. 1.5 months, p=0.045) on univariate analysis. Younger age (＜ 66 years) trended towards improved median survival (28.0 months vs. 4.8 months, p=0.055). There was eight local failures, two of which were isolated local failures. There were two treatment-related deaths. Conclusions: Outcome of low dose gemcitabine CCRT for cholangiocarcinoma seems promising. Those with better baseline performance status are most likely to benefit from this treatment. Definitive gemcitabine based CCRT for loco-regional cholangiocarcinoma may be an alternative to primary surgery.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: Follow recommendation of AAPM report no.142; applying EBT3 film to process routine quality assurance for Varian Millennium 120-Leaf multileaf collimator. Materials and Methods: The study was designed the specific pattern for MLC quality assurance and acquired the images by EBT3 film. The commercial software can be analyzing the images scanned from EBT3 film and creating reference values. The monthly QA items was included setting versus radiation field for two patterns、travel speed and leaf position accuracy. The items for annual QA was consisted of MLC transmission for all energies, leaf position repeatability, MLC spoke shot, coincidence of light field and x-ray field and IMRT testing for segment and sliding window. The paper was described particularly for the QA procedure, method of exposed film and specific testing pattern. Results: The results of quality assurance for Varian Millennium 120-Leaf were satisfied with criteria which were recorded on AAPM report no.142. The QA reference values were only available for this specific MLC on this linear accelerator. The paper is presenting the QA procedure of Varian Millennium 120-Leaf MLC using EBT3 film and appropriate software. Discussions: Several MLC QA reference values could be consist with record on customer acceptance procedure document. Due to MLC was installed lower level than collimator but on same gantry head. The result of MLC spoke shot could be same with collimator spoke shot. The accuracy of leaf position must be varying with gantry angle causing gravity.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This reasearch was focused on the measured surface dose of the simulated phantom for breast cancer patients treated with field-in-field (FIF) and irregular surface compensator (ISC) and the reliable measured tools to evaluate the skin dose of breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: This experiment adopted 0.1mm ultrathin thermoluminescent dosimeters (ultrathin TLD) and ISP Gafchromic EBT film as the measured tool to establish the characteristics. Superficial doses of home-made breast on anthropomorphic Rando phantom were measured. FIF and ISC plans with a prescribed dose of 180 cGy were designed on this phantom using an Eclipse treatment planning system and using two measured tools to measure the absolute surface dose. Result: In this experiment the variance coefficient of TLD film was within 3%. The reading values and delivered doses were in a good linear relationship. The points on calibration curve of Gafchromic film were within 1% and in a stable performance. Mean surface measured doses of FIF and ISC with the EBT film and TLD film were 108.74 ± 14.86 cGy, 107.35 ± 15.93 cGy and 103.19 ± 12.91 cGy, 102.09 ± 10.02 cGy, respectively. The error between EBT film and TLD film for the inner, middle, outer, upper, lower regions of home-made breast and the total mean dose of FIF was 5.17%, -3.45%, 1.58%, 1.27%, -0.55% and 1.3%, respectively; the error between EBT film and TLD film for the inner, middle, outer, upper, lower regions of home-made breast and the total mean dose of ISC was 1.86%, 2.94%, 8.3%, -3.44%, -5% and 1.08%, respectively. Conclusion and Discussion: From the experimental results, ultrathin TLD and EBT film can be adopted as the measured tools for surface dose of breast cancer patients. The future work for this research could gather statistics of the skin reactions indeed affected by the skin dose received from radiation for clinical applications. To evaluate severity of skin reaction and measure most accurate skin dose, and this data can be used references for skin reaction gradings.',\n",

       " 'Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma that is a low-grade malignancy and rarely presents with distant metastasis. According to previously reported cases, it is possible that the presence of calculi may cause chronic inflammation and traumatic irritation; this mechanism seems to promote the development of VC in the upper part of urinary tract. We present a case of verrucous carcinoma of the right renal pelvis and right ureter. Such tumors may cause severe urinary tract obstruction. Surgical treatment is the main modality of therapy. This patient received nephro-ureterectomy. Furthermore, because a microscopic residual tumor was found at the cut end of ureter, the patient also received adjuvant radiotherapy.',\n",

However, myoclonus is seldom found. We report on a 33-year-old man diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) cT1N1M0. He had undergone concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) with Cetuximab (Erbitux) and curative radiotherapy (RT) with a dose of 7000cGy in 33 fractions. He developed a myoclonic jerk in the left neck 2.5 years after CCRT. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed roughly 60% stenosis of the left proximal internal carotid artery. He did not receive any invasive intervention for carotid stenosis and the neck myoclonus was well controlled by an annual local Botox injection for 3 years.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To analyze the treatment outcomes of radiation therapy (RT) in breast cancer patients who developed locoregional recurrence (LRR) after initial treatment with mastectomy, and to investigate the prognostic factors influencing survival. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of breast cancer patients who received RT for post-mastectomy LRR in our hospital from 1989 to 2009. Patients who had previous RT and distant metastasis before LRR were excluded, but patients with synchronous distant metastasis were included in this study. Clinicopathologic parameters and outcomes were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate local recurrence progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasis -free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to assess the prognostic significance of these clinicopathologic parameters on survival. Results: One hundred and fifty-five patients were included in the study. Median followup time was 9.8 years. Thirty-one (20.0%) patients had synchronous metastasis at the diagnosis of LRR, while 124 (80%) patients had not. The median OS for patients with and without synchronous metastasis were 1.6 and 4.2 years, respectively (P= 0.001), but there was no difference on LRPFS between these two groups (P= 0.33). Among the 124 patients without synchronous metastasis, the 5-year LRPFS, DMFS and OS for were 58.9%, 35.4% and 46%, respectively. Eighty-three patients (67%) subsequently developed distant metastases. Patients with chest wall recurrence had a significantly better 5-year OS than patients with isolated LN or multiple sites recurrences (56.3% vs. 39.8% vs. 27.8%, P= 0.04). Multivariate analysis for patients without synchronous metastasis revealed that sites of LRR and initial stage were significant prognostic factors for LRPFS, while aggressive local therapy (including surgery and RT), initial stage and salvage systemic therapy were significant prognostic factors affecting OS. Conclusions: Locoregional recurrent breast cancer carries a high risk of distant metastasis. Use of aggressive local therapy and systemic therapy can achieve good survival outcomes in a substantial proportion of patients.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: The aim of this retrospective study is to quantify dose irradiated to the heart and the left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA) in left breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant breast radiotherapy and analyse the probable causes of high dose to the heart and LADCA. Methods and Materials: Twenty-one consecutive patients with left-sided breast cancer who underwent adjuvant radiotherapy to the breast between August 2012 and October 2013 are enrolled in our study. All patients were irradiated with 6- or 10-MV tangential beams to the breast and seven patients of them also received supraclavicular fossa (SCF) irradiation with IMRT technique. For each dose plan, dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the heart and LADCA were calculated and analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between average heart D_(mean) (mean dose), LAD D_(mean) and LAD_(max) (maximum dose) and between LAD D_(mean) and volume of LADCA in the radiation fields (i.e., it received ＞25 Gy). Student's t test was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in radiation dose to LADCA and heart between patients who received SCF IMRT or not. Results: For the 21 patients given left breast irradiation, the average mean [range] dose was 4.04 [1.75-11.15] Gy to the heart and 21.29 [6.99-35.28] Gy to the LADCA, and the average maximum dose was 54.31 [50.55-58.42] Gy to the LADCA. There is significant correlation between D_(mean) to the heart and LADCA (r= 0.80, p ＜ 0.01). The D_(mean) to LADCA was postulated to increase 3.44 Gy for each increase of 1 Gy in the mean radiation dose delivered to the heart in our study. There is significant correlation between Dmean to LADCA and the volume of LAD in the radiation fields (i.e., it received ＞25 Gy) (r= 0.94, p＜ 0.0001). The D_(mean) to LADCA was postulated to increase 0.77 Gy for each increase of 1 ml of LADCA volume in the radiation field. For 7 patients who received left-tangential radiotherapy and SCF IMRT, the average mean dose was 4.15 [2.58-8.9] Gy to the heart and 21.93 [16.49-35.21] Gy to the LADCA, and the average maximum dose was 55.21 [52.63-57.79] Gy to the LADCA. SCF IMRT contributed to average mean dose 0.15 [0.05-0.35] Gy and average maximum dose 0.43 [0.15-0.68] Gy to the LADCA. There is no significant difference in Dmean to the LADCA and heart between patients who received SCF IMRT or not (p= 0.38, p= 0.45, respectively). Conclusion: For patients receiving left-tangential radiotherapy, the higher Dmean to the LADCA was strongly correlated to the larger volume of LADCA in the radiation fields. There is significant correlation between D_(mean) to the heart and LADCA. The patients with the higher mean heart dose had the higher mean LADCA dose. We may suggest to limit mean dose to LADCA by avoiding volume of LADCA in the treatment fields if well visualized LADCA on CT scan or limiting the mean heart dose to lower mean LADCA dose if poor visualization of LADCA on CT scan.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: Radiation therapy is the major treatment modality in head and neck cancer other than surgical intervention, Some patients did not complete the radiation therapy course that in turn compromise the treatment response. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and interventional factors that affect the completion of radiation therapy, and help to improve the quality of nursing care in radiation therapy. Materials & Methods: From January 1 to June 30 in 2013, total 203 patients with head and neck cancer were referred to our radiation therapy department were reviewed. The completion of radiation therapy is defined as 90% of planned radiation dose was delivered. The association between the completion of radiation therapy and their personal characteristics, clinical status and nursing interventions were analyzed. Chi-square test was used for evaluate the proportion of complete treatment in different factors and Logistic regression was applied to define independent factors for completion of radiation therapy. Results: There were 203 head and neck cancer patients received radiation therapy enrolled in this study. Total 174 patients (85.7%) had completed the radiation therapy course. In Chi-square test, the patients who were without distant metastases (p= 0.024) and without chronic systematic disease (p= 0.044) had higher completion rate. For interventional factors, patients who accepted patient instructions (p＜ 0.001), nutritional consultation (P＜ 0.001) and image-guided radiation therapy by self-paid (p= 0.004) were also had a better completion rate for radiation therapy course. In Logistic regression, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less or equal to 1 (p= 0.049), without distant metastases (p= 0.032), patients who had conselling of patient instructions (p= 0.004) and nutritional consultation (P= 0.004) were the independent factors for completion of radiation therapy course. Nutritional consultation and patient instructions were the most significant independent factors for completion of radiation therapy, and the odd ratio were 8.902 and 8.012, respectively. Nutritional consultation, patient instructions and image-guided radiation therapy by self-paid are interrelated with a higher completion rate of radiation therapy course. The most common reasons for interruption of radiation therapy were intolerante to and anxious of the treatment complications in 48.3% (14/29) patients, following by sickness and weakness in 34.5% (10/29) patients. Conclusion: Nutritional consultation and patient instructions are the most significant interventional factors for the completion of radiation therapy course in head and neck cancer. The compliance of radiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients may be improved via the intervention of nutritional consultation and patient instructions.',\n",
       " 'Objectives: Using computed tomography (CT) scanning to evaluate the clinical applicability of intensity modulated gel dosimeter based on the dose distribution. Materials and Approaches: A Clinac iX linear accelerator (Varian, USA) was adopted as the radiation source to irradiate an N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) polymer gel dosimetry. After the polymerization reaction, the gel was scanned using a HiSpeed CT scanner (GE, USA), and sliced images of the gel were analyzed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Next, the gamma test obtained for the treatment plan and the NIPAM polymer gel were compared. Results: The results indicated that using numerous CT images to calculate the mean CT numbers of the images can substantially reduce CT noise. In addition, when the polymer gel was unilluminated and background subtraction occurred, the ring artifacts produced in the first experiment disappeared. Furthermore, the gamma test increased from 68.40% to 95.02% pass rate. The gel dose distribution yielded in the second experiment was similar to that of the treatment plan system, and the obtained gamma test was 97.57% pass rate. Discussion and Conclusion: The results showed that X-ray CT scanning can be applied to clinical polymer gel dosimeters.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To investigate the performance and feasibilities of four different linac-based radiation therapy devices in palliating a lung adenocarcinoma patient presenting with diffuse pleural seeding and intractable pain. Patients and Methods: Treatment plans were generated for three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), Volumetric- modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and Helical Tomotherapy (HT) using 6 MV photon beam with adequate optimization criteria. The total prescribed dose to planning target volume (PTV) was 50 Gy in 20 fractions. Dose distributions to PTV and organs at risk (OAR) were compared using dose-volume histograms (DVHs), conformity indexes (CIs), and homogeneity indexes (HIs). Results: In general, IMRT, VMAT and HT all resulted in comparable PTV coverage. The D98 of all four techniques were all greater than 48.5 Gy. HT had the highest CI (0.982) and the lowest HI (0.035), whereas 3D-CRT had the highest D2% (56.82 Gy) and Dmax (58 Gy). HT had the lowest ipsilateral lung V45 (55%) and ipsilateral mean lung dose (45 Gy). 3D-CRT had the lowest contralateral lung V18 (0%) and contralateral mean lung dose (1.14 Gy). The integral dose (L.Gy) for total lung tissue was VMAT ＞ HT ＞ IMRT ＞ 3D-CRT. HT delivered the most monitor units (MUs) and needed the longest treatment time. Conclusion: IMRT, VMAT and HT all could attain over 95% PTV coverage and had superior OAR sparing compared to 3D-CRT. However, larger volumes of some healthy tissues (especially contralateral lung) received low-to-intermediate doses, which contributed to a higher integral dose in VMAT, HT and IMRT. The superiority of one technique over another needed further clinical correlation.',\n",
       " \"Objective: As patients with breast cancer are recruited to participate in a survey on the effectiveness of health education in radiotherapy, the IRB of some hospitals will, to protect the patient's interest, ask the investigators to explain the survey to the patient and ask the patient to sign an informed consent form before the questionnaire can be distributed. In practice, however, some patients would like to participate in the survey and answer the questionnaire but may be unwilling to sign the consent form. This study was designed to investigate: (1) The proportion of participants unwilling to sign the consent form. (2) If the questionnaire was anonymous and didn't involve patient's privacy and medical interests, can the consent form be waived? (3) If the patient takes the questionnaire home, answers it, and returns to the investigators, can this be regarded as a voluntary response? Materials and Methods: The questionnaires were distributed to patients in four different groups consecutively. The informed consent process of these groups were designed to differ a little so as to identify their effects on the response rate, the rate of unsigned consent form, and the invalid questionnaire rate. Results: Except the first group (asking the patient to sign the consent form), the other groups (at the patient’s discretion) had about 20 to 30% of the respondents who declined to sign the consent form. In the second group, the informed consent process was too simplistic; hence it had the lowest response rate. In the first and the third groups, the informed consent process was more elaborate, but the invalid rate was high. In the fourth group, the informed consent process was the most complete, as a result, the response rate was high and the invalid rate was the lowest. Conclusion: (1) At the patient's discretion, about 20 to 30 percent of the respondents declined to sign the consent form. (2) If an anonymous questionnaire does not involve patient's privacy and medical interests, instructions may be used instead (without requiring a signature as evidence) lest the patient feel uneasy. (3) If a participant takes the questionnaire home, answers it, and returns to the investigator, this may be regarded as a voluntary response.\",\n",
       " 'Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) account for approximately 10% to 15% of intracranial vascular malformations. The current management of cerebral DAVFs includes a multimodal approach involving surgery, endovascular therapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). A 52 years-old female suffered from progressive pulsatile tinnitus of left ear for about 3 months and her symptoms didn’t response to medical treatment. Her angiography showed numerous DAVFs without cortical venous reflux in left sigmoid sinus. She was referred to Radiation Oncology clinic for SRS, because surgery or endovascular therapy was not recommended. A thermoplastic mask was done for patient fixation. Then, the patient underwent a thin-sliced contrast-enhanced MRI exam with contrast enhancement and CT simulation without contrast enhancement. Abnormal fistulas and vessel were contoured on MRI images which were fused with CT images. Before SRS, pairs of orthogonal films and cone beam CT images which obtained by on-board imager were used for image guidance. Radiation dose was delivered with dynamic multileaf collimator in five non-coplanar arcs by a linear accelerator. The prescription dose was 20 Gy and the maximal dose was 21.9 Gy. The symptom of pulsatile tinnitus had been improved gradually since SRS and completely disappeared at about 2 months after SRS. Follow-up MRI at 3 and 9 months and angiography at 1 year after SRS suggested complete obliteration of DAVFs. No radiation-induced change at the perimeter of the lesion was observed by MRI or other chronic toxicity was reported at 1 year after SRS.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: Granulosa cell tumor (GCT) of the ovary is classified as a sex cord stromal tumor, representing approximately 2-5% of ovarian neoplasms, and adult type accounts 95% of all GCTs, usually occurs in women during 50-55 years old. The most important prognostic factor of this tumor is stage, with 10-year overall survival of 84-95% for stage I tumors, decreasing to 50-65% for stage II tumors, and to 0-22% for stage III and IV disease. Case report: A 56-year-old woman with left side ovarian granulosa cell tumor, at least clinical FIGO stage IIIa, underwent debulking operation on February 23rd, 2002. After surgery, she received four cycles adjuvant chemotherapy with the regimen of Bleomycin, Cisplatin and Etoposide. Then she received postoperative whole-abdomen and pelvis irradiation. The dose was given 2520 cGy in 21 fractions with liver and kidney shielding. After whole-abdomen and pelvis irradiation, she received pelvis boost with the dose of 1980 cGy in 11 fractions. Since then, she was regularly followed at our hospital until now without any signs of tumor recurrence nor tumor progression. Discussion: Until now there is no standard and proven treatment for GCT patients, especially when they suffered from advanced-stage or recurrent unresectable tumors. Complete tumor resection should be considered as the primary treatment. The optimal choice of combination platinum-based chemotherapy is still not well-defined. The role of adjuvant radiation therapy remains controversial. We suggested that adjuvant RT for patients with GCT might improve outcomes in selected patients.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To investigate the clinical features and survival outcomes of second primary malignancies (SPM) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after definitive radiotherapy. Materials and Methods: From January 1984 to August 2010, a total of 2208 patients with pathologically-proven NPC who received curative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were screened for the occurrence of SPM. Fifty-eight patients were eligible for the final analysis. We reviewed hospital charts, radiotherapy records and diagnostic imaging studies thoroughly and analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment courses, and survival outcomes. Results: The overall incidence of SPM in this study was 2.6% (58/2208). The cumulative incidences at 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, and 25 years were 1.5%, 4.7%, 5.6%, 9.2%, and 14%, respectively. Head and neck (H&N) was the most common site of SPM (29.3%), followed by the lung (19.0%), colon/rectum (12.1%) and female breast (12.1%). The median survival after diagnosis of SPM was 3 years (range, 1 month-10.9 years). The 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates after SPM diagnosis were 52.3%, 29.5%, and 11.8%, respectively. Patients with SPM arising from the breast/ colon/rectum had better survival than those with SPM arising from the H&N/lung/liverpancreas- stomach (5-year OS rates, 56.3% vs. 15.8%, p=0.0029). Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of SPM in NPC patients after definitive radiotherapy increased over time. Head and neck cancer is the most common site of SPM. Patients with SPM of colon/rectum and female breast had the best survival outcome.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes following reirradiation (re-RT) with or without chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or residual esophageal cancer after primary definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) or radiotherapy (RT). Materials and Methods: From 2007 to 2010, 38 patients with recurrent or residual esophageal cancer who had received definitive CCRT or RT were analyzed. The pathology of all patients was squamous cell carcinoma. Among these patients, 24 received re-RT (group A). Eighteen of these patients received re-RT combined with chemotherapy and 6 received re-RT alone. External-beam radiotherapy was administered to 18 patients and intraluminal brachytherapy to 6 patients. The remaining 14 patients (group B) were treated using chemotherapy or provided supportive care. The study endpoint was to identify overall survival (OS). These rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test and Cox regression were performed to compare the variables. Results: After a median follow-up duration of 14.4 months (range, 1.7-68.6), 29 patients were dead. The median OS time for the entire cohort was 10.6 ± 1.8 months, whereas the OS for group A and B was 13.7 ± 2.3 months and 4.38 ± 0.9 months respectively (P=.001). According to the multivariate analysis, patients received re-RT had a longer OS than those without re-RT. (hazard ratio=0.30, 95% Confidence Interval 0.10-0.89, P=.031). Conclusion: Our study results indicate that re-RT might be feasible in patients with recurrent or residual esophageal cancer who had received previous CCRT or RT. Further studies are required to identify those who will be benefited from re-RT.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast (MCB) is a rare subtype of breast cancer and characterized by the histologic presence of two or more cellular types of epithelial and mesenchymal components. The purpose of the study is to review the clinicopathologic features and outcomes of MCB treated with radiation therapy (RT) at our institution. Materials and Methods: Patients with MCB of the breast who did not have distant metastasis at diagnosis and received curative-intent RT at our institution were identified. Clinicopathologic features were collected and outcomes were analyzed. We used Kaplan-Meier statistic method to estimate local control, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in these patients. Results: From 1996 to 2012, twelve MCB patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Patient age ranged from 29 to 66 years (mean, 48). The median tumor size was 5.3 cm (range, 1.2-19). Nine patients (75%) were nodal negative. Triple negative tumors (ie, ER negative, PR negative and HER2 negative) were found in 9 of 12 patients (75%). Nine patients received mastectomy while 3 patients underwent breast conserving surgery. RT dose ranged from 50-66 Gy (mean, 60). No patient developed local recurrence after RT. The median DFS was 4.2 years. Overall survival was 52.5% at 5 years. Conclusions: Our findings suggest adjuvant RT is a very effective adjuvant treatment on local tumor control for patients with MCB.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Radiation therapy is an important treatment method for head and neck cancer. The parotid gland, submandibular gland and minor salivary gland are often irradiated due to being adjacent to the target volumes. Although advancing radiotherapy techniques have reduced the dose of radiation to normal tissues and toxicity, the radiation dose distributed to the parotid gland remains high, causing a considerable amount of xerostomia. The aim of this study is to reduce the dose of radiation to the left parotid gland by inserting a spacer into the medial parotid space and separating it from the target volume. Materials and Methods: A minimally invasive procedure was developed to create a space medial to the left parotid gland in experimental swine, and a spacer was inserted into this space. A computed tomography simulator and radiation therapy planning system was used to analyze the distribution of the radiation dose to the putative gross disease, high risk clinical target volume, and parotid glands. Statistics obtained by using a paired t test were used to compare the dosimetry parameters with or without the insertion of the spacer. Results: The dose of radiation to the parotid glands was found to be significantly reduced by the demand for a similar coverage and conformity of the putative target volume for the gross disease (PTV 70 Gy) and high risk nodal region (PTV 63 Gy) with 2 Gy per fraction. Before the space was created, the left and right parotid glands were estimated to receive a mean dose of 2808 ± 205 cGy and 2901 ± 189 cGy, respectively. After the spacer was inserted into the left medial parotid gland space, the left and right parotid glands were estimated to receive a mean dose of 2027 ± 364 cGy and 2972 ± 114 cGy respectively. Therefore, the spacer had made a significant difference in the dose to the ipsilateral (left) parotid gland (p=0.003) without affecting the contralateral (right) one (p=0.36). Conclusion: An experimental model was developed by using spacers to create a space between the left parotid gland and the target volume, which markedly reduced the dose to the left parotid gland. Both short and long term functional assays for parotid damage in animals is warranted.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: While a variety of information and practice management systems are available (e.g., MOSAIQ from Elekta), these information systems are specific to radiation oncology and are quite difficult to integrate with existing hospital Health Information System (HIS) in Taiwan. A one-touch solution to integrate diverse information systems was proposed to readily access radiotherapy information in real time wherever and whenever needed. Materials and Methods: First, we identified all existing processes and the distribution of information between HIS in the hospital and MOSAIQ in the department of radiation oncology. Then a one-touch solution (OTS) was implemented using several information technologies, including HL7 message exchange, SQL query, and dynamic web pages. It allowed authenticated users to obtain the radiotherapy information such as treatment sites, dose and fractions, and start/end date of radiotherapy on authorized computer workstations or mobile devices in an intuitive and rapid way. Results: The ability to exchange data between MOSAIQ and hospital HIS with just one touch was successfully implemented for daily clinical use. The mean time for users to retrieve up-to-date radiotherapy information for each patient and record it in hospital HIS was significantly decreased to 1 sec with OTS compared to 12.7 sec with searching data in MOSAIQ and 47.1 sec with manual transfer of paper charts (p＜0.05 for both comparisons). Conclusion: OTS can facilitate the exchange of radiotherapy data between different information systems. It can free up radiation oncologists from doing repetitive tasks, and allow them to focus on other important tasks to improve the quality and safety of radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: In prostate radiation therapy, inter-fractional organ motion/deformation has posed significant challenges on reliable daily dose delivery. To evaluate the set-up errors and dose impact at clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (PTV) coverage and critical organ with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT); off-line re-optimization and online re-positioning have been used clinically. Materials and Methods: Between 2011 and 2013, 12 patients with prostate cancer were treated with IGRT to a dose of 75.6 Gy with daily correction of the target position based on Elekta Synergy X-ray cone beam computed tomography system, image-guided radiation therapy practiced with VMAT. We captured each space coordinates in every fraction with dose redistribution to form a new dose distribution with the Pyton software. The real dose with recalculation and stacking with new three dimensional coordinates from each fraction were compared with initial plan. The dose at CTV, PTV coverage and critical organ were reevaluated. Results: The average shift of ML (medial-lateral), CC (cranio-caudal) and AP (anterior-posterior) were 2 mm±1 mm, 3 mm±3 mm and 4 mm±3 mm. The calculated systematic errors in ML, AP and CC direction were 0.8 mm, 2.0 mm and 1.6 mm. The calculated random errors in ML, AP and CC direction were 1.22 mm, 1.7 mm and 2.1 mm. The coverage of CTV and PTV with recalculation were significantly decreased from 100% to 96% and 97.5% to 86.9% respectively. There was no statistical difference in the dose to organ at risk. IGRT will be necessary in our study. Though CTV coverage decrease from 100% to 96%, but the PTV coverage decrease from 97.5% to 86.9% reaching statistical significance. Conclusions: IGRT would be beneficial for prostate cancer treatment with VMAT really. CBCT image guide VMAT in radiotherapy to prostate cancer not only shortened the treatment time but also decreased the uncertainty of set-up within each fraction. The specific dose to critical organs and tumor would be more exact compared with radiotherapy without IGRT. The less side effect and better tumor control might be expected in the future after proof of new randomized clinical trial.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To investigate the feasibility of using PTW 2D-Array detecting system in IMRT dosimetric quality assurance, we propose a mathematical and efficient method. The method uses the multiple acquisition sequence to increase the resolution. Then the measured results and calculated results are analyzed and compared. Materials and Methods: We use PTW-seven29 2D Array as the detecting system and PTW-RW3 Slab Phantom as solid phantom. With 15 cm-thickness solid phantom and CT images, the dosimetric distribution is calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). The phantom source surface distance (SSD) is 95 cm and the 2D distribution at the 5 cm depth is as the calculated result. By combining the measured results in different acquisition sequence, we can get the dosimetric distribution in different theory resolution. The relation between the low-resolution and high-resolution results is analyzed. In advance we combine the calculated result to get the Gamma index in different theory resolution. Results: We find that using the multiple acquisition sequence really increases the measured resolution in the 2D-Array detecting system. And the number of measuring times is direct ratio to the theoretic resolution. For example combining the four-times measures in different position can get the fourfold-theory resolution. In comparing the measured results with calculated results, the fourfold-theory resolution is the most efficient and passes the Gamma index test. However using eightfold-theory resolution is better but needs more time in quality assurance. Conclusions: We find that using the multiple acquisition sequence in the 2D-Array detecting system increases the measuring resolution and really is feasible in dosimetric quality assurance.',\n",
       " 'Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare but lethal condition. Here, we present a case of AEF following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the middle third esophagus and was treated by CCRT with a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions using IMRT. AEF developed within 1 month after completion of CCRT, with a presentation of massive hematemesis and hypovolemic shock. For uncontrolled bleeding, angiography for transcatheter arterial embolization was arranged. A subarcuate AEF was highly suspected with contrast flow along the esophagus noted in the contrast test series. No definite feeding arterial branch of the hemorrhagic lesion could be recognized, thus an embolizing procedure was not performed. Then he received emergent descending aortic endografting for AEF. His hemodynamic status and oxygenation became relatively stable. However, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and passed away three days later. The aorta consists of strong muscular layer, and we do not believe the moderate dose of radiotherapy alone induced such rare complication. We are inclined to assume that solid food induced a penetrating ulcer of the esophagus and thoracic aorta after improvement of dysphagia. Owing to the rare occurrence, it is hard to set a tolerance dose threshold to the aorta in treating tumors adjacent to it. Nevertheless, we still should keep in mind the possibility of this rare complication with substantial mortality and inform patients before beginning radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : We here report the preliminary treatment and toxicity outcome of definitive radical radiotherapy for patients with adenocarcinoma of prostate in an era of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in our institution and analyze the possible prognostic factors. Materials and Methods : During 2003 and 2010, 564 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of prostate receiving radical definitive radiotherapy in our institution were retrospectively reviewed with a median follow-up of 63 months. Among the 542 patients without evident lymphadenopathy (N0) on CT or MRI, there were 97 (17.2%), 181 (32.1%), 214 (37.9%), and 50 (8.9%) in low, intermediate, high, and very high risk groups respectively, based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk classification criteria. Another 22 (3.9%) patients showed regional lymphadenopathy (N1). Median prescription dose was 78 Gy. There were 453 (80.3%) patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Among them, 62 (11.1%) received adjuvant ADT for more than 2 years. Results : The 5-year overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) and biochemical failure free survival (BFFS) of all patients were 90.3%, 97.9%, 94%, and 87.1% respectively. The 5-year BFFS were 98.2%, 94.6%, 81.2%, and 75.7% for patients of low, intermediate, high, and very high risk groups, respectively. For patients with N1 disease, the 5-year BFFS was down to 49.9%. The difference of BFFS between patients of high and very high risk groups was significant only in those who had MRI for staging. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that T-stage, Gleason score, and initial PSA risk groups, and age of 80 or older were significant risk factors of BFFS. Pelvic irradiation significantly increased acute GI toxicity with odds ratio of 1.486 (95% confidence interval 1.059-2.086). Grade 3 or more late toxicity was noted in 23 patients (4.1%) in GU system and 33 patients (5.9%) in GI system. Only 4 (0.7%) patients had persistent GU toxicity and 1 (0.2%) had persistent GI toxicity at the last follow-up date. Multivariate Cox regression showed the mean dose to rectum above 48 Gy to be the only significant factor for late GI bleeding. Conclusions : The treatment outcome of our institution was comparable to published results of IMRT. The higher risk groups of T stage, Gleason score, initial PSA, and age of 80 or older, were significant risk factors for BFFS. Pelvic irradiation modestly increased acute GI toxicity. MRI was more accurate for BFFS prognosis. Late GI bleeding was associated with a mean dose above 48 Gy to the rectum.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Women with HER-2 overexpressing breast carcinoma benefit from trastuzumab-based systemic therapy despite the awareness of increasing risk of brain failure from this treatment modality among several studies. We report the treatment outcome and patterns of failure in women with operable HER2-positive breast cancer using trastuzumab as adjuvant setting at our institution, furthermore, focus on the incidence of central nervous system failure and the predictors for those with high risk of developing CNS relapse. Method and Material: We retrospectively identified 243 women with HER2-positive operable breast cancer diagnosed and treated at our institution between June 2002 and December 2011. All patients with tumor size more than two centimeters or any positive lymph node received adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab. Central nervous system failure was recognized through clinical symptoms and neuro-images during follow up. We estimated the event - free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and brain-metastasis free survival (BMFS) using Kaplan-Meier method, and performed cox-proportional hazards models to assess the impact of clinical-pathologic parameters on EFS, OS. The covariates for predicting CNS relapse either as first site or as sequential event during follow up were also analyzed. Results: With median follow up of 63.57 months (range 8.8~132.4months) of entire cohort, the five year event-free survival rate, overall survival rate, and brain-metastasis free survival was 72%, 85%, and 92%, respectively. Forty-three of sixty first events (71.7%) were distal relapse which remained the main failure type of our cohort. The five year cumulative incidence of different first events, included loco-regional recurrence, CNS relapse, distal non-CNS relapse, second primary, and non-cancer death, were 4.7%, 2.57%, 15.83%, 1.46%, and 0.4%. Central nervous system failure either as first site of recurrence or as a sequential event was noted in six and ten women. No adjuvant trastuzumab, positive lymph node number more than nine, and dermis involvement significantly predicted poorer event free survival on uni-and-multivariate analysis(p= 0.001, ＜ 0.001, 0.042, respectively). These factors also translated in predicting overall survival. No significant predictor was noted for the occurrence of CNS relapse as first site (5-year cumulative incidence: 1.86% and 3.02% in patients with or without adjuvant trastuzumab, p= 0.633). The negatively prognostic factors for brain-metastasis free survival were positive lymph node number more than nine, lymphovascular invasion, and high grade tumor (p= 0.043, ＜0.001, and ＜0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Using adjuvant trastuzumab improves event-free survival and overall survival in women with stage II /III HER2-positive breast cancer. The development of CNS relapse did not increase in our patients receiving trastuzumab based adjuvant therapy. Brain image as part of follow up might be considered, especially for those with positive lymph node number more than nine, high grade tumor, and with lymphovascular invasion. Larger prospective data or data from published randomized trials is needed for determining patients with high risks of developing CNS relapse.',\n",
       " 'Purpose/Objectives: Although choroidal melanoma is a relatively rare disease in Taiwan, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using linear accelerator based hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for choroidal melanoma. Materials and Methods: From 2009 to 2012, 6 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated for a total dose of 50 Gy in 5 fractions with SRT. All patients underwent image studies (CT or MRI) and ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, funduscopy and ultrasound, before and regularly after treatment. In this study, three patients had medium-sized tumors (tumor height ≤ 10 mm and tumor base ≤ 16 mm) and the other three had large-sized tumors (tumor height ＞10 mm or tumor base ＞16 mm). Results: With a median follow-up duration of 29 months, the 3-year local control, distant metastasis free and overall survival were all 100%. One patient had enucleation due to the development of radiation-induced neovascular glaucoma after 25 months. In addition, one patient developed a cataract after 24 months and received an intraocular lens implant. Among the four patients with pre-treatment visual acuity ＞0.1(VA), VA was preserved in 3 patients. Conclusions: Our study supports the theory that hypofractionated SRT with 50Gy applied in five fractions seems to be sufficient to obtain good tumor control. More efforts should be made to reduce the radiation-induced neovascular glaucoma and preserve visual acuity.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To describe the change of quality of life (QoL) and complications in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after treatment. Materials and Methods: Total 288 NPC patients in two institutions were invited to participate; all the patients received radiation doses of at least 70 Gy to the nasopharynx and at least 50 Gy to the neck. Health-related QoL and complications of the patients were evaluated by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the EORTC head and neck module (QLQ-H&N35) before treatment, end of treatment, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment. The effects of time, demographic, disease-related and treatmentrelated variables to QoL and complications were analyzed by the generalized estimating equation. Results: Comparing to pre-treatment, the NPC patients had the worst global QoL and functional status after completion of radiotherapy. The global QoL status improved rapidly at 1 month post-treatment and increased steadily, however, the global functional status had a delayed effect that patient recovered until 12 months after radiotherapy. The alleviations of the major complications were quite different. Speech problem was resolved at 12 months after treatment, pain at 18 months, the problem of open mouth at 24 months, but some complications such as dry mouth, sticky saliva and difficult swallowing still persist even 24 months after treatment. Conclusion: The QoL and complications show wide variations and time dependent. Our study can aid clinical physicians in assessing the risk of complications related to treatment, and help them in providing rehabilitation, consultation and supportive care to NPC patients after completion of treatment.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of bladder filling on uterus-cervix mobility in patients with cervical cancer and an intact uterus treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods and Materials: Twenty-two consecutive women with cervical cancer (FIGO stage IB-IVB) receiving pelvic IMRT were selected for analysis. Two series of treatment planning CT scans, one with a full bladder and the other with an empty bladder, were acquired. The target volumes and normal tissues were contoured on each CT scan according to the updated guidelines and staging MRI. We determined the centroid positions of the cervical tumor and uterus, then correlated the centroid displacement to the delta volume of the bladder (DVB; defined as the volume difference between full and empty urinary bladders; the maximized bladder filling change). Results: A significant mobility of the uterus-cervix according to bladder filling was observed on the superior-inferior axis only. For all patients, displacement of the uteruscervix on the superior-inferior axis was significantly correlated with the DVB (adjusted R2= 0.49, p= 0.0005). Among 8 patients with cervical tumor invading less than onehalf of the uterus, the target displacement affected by DVB was well-described by linear regression (adjusted R2= 0.61, p= 0.0008). For those with bulky tumor extent, the correlation between target displacement and DVB was much less apparent. For patients have anteverted uterus (n= 11), the DVB was associated with cervix-uterus motion on superior-inferior axis (adjusted R2 =0.40, p= 0.022), while for those with retroverted or tip-up uterus, there was no significant correlation. After a multivariate linear regression analysis, DVB and tumor extent were significantly correlated with uterus-cervix motion. Conclusion: The maximized bladder filling change (DVB), and tumor extent, were significantly correlated with uterus-cervix centroid displacement on the superiorinferior axis of cervical cancer patients.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The risk of developing brain metastases in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is approximately 22%-55% and has been discussed in many studies. However the risk for patients with early stage NSCLC is less defined. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk factors of developing brain metastases in early stage NSCLC. Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed with early stage (clinical T1-2, N0-1, M0) NSCLC in our institution from Jan, 2007 to Jun, 2012 were surveyed. Exclusion criteria were (1) patients who did not received regular follow up at our hospital or those with missing data or who had a follow up time ＜ 3 months. (2) Double cancer (3) pathological ＞T2 or ＞N1 disease. Factors such as age at diagnosis, gender, cell type, histological grade, T stage, N stage, different pulmonary lobe, performance status and treatment modality were reviewed from their chart records and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression to estimate the association and significance with brain metastases. Results: From Jan, 2007 to Jun, 2012, 260 patients were diagnosed with early stage NSCLC. Eighty three patients were excluded and 177 were enrolled in this study. The median follow up time of all the patients was 28.4 months (range, 3-74 months). Brain metastases were identified in 18 patients. The 5-year risk of developing brain metastases was 19%. The median time from diagnosis to brain metastases was 17.8 months (range, 1.8-60.6 months) and the median age at diagnosis was 69.5 years. In univariate and multivariate analysis, stage (T2) and surgery status (without surgery) had strong associations with developing brain metastases (p= 0.007 and 0.001 in univariate, p= 0.028 and 0.007 in multivariate respectively). Age (＞60 y/o) showed a trend towards association with brain metastases in multivariate analysis (p= 0.053). Conclusions: Our results showed that the 5-year risk of developing brain metastases was 19% in early stage NSCLC. Tumor stage (T2) and surgery status (without surgery) were significant predictors for brain metastases.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The Carbon Fiber Respiratory Control Board (CFRCB) (Blessing-Cathay Corp.) was used to suppress the organ motions due to respiratory. The attenuation effects of CFRCB will affect the dose accuracy in radiation treatment plans. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the attenuation effects with different measurement field sizes and gantry angle due to the Carbon Fiber Respiratory Control Board. Materials and Methods: The CT numbers of CFRCB would be analyzed to predict the electron density and attenuation of each components. The attenuation factors of CFRCB were measured with rotated gantry angles in 6 MV and 10 MV using a Varian iX Linac machine. In the measurements, the CFRCB compressed from anterior (gantry= 180°) to the center of plastic water phantoms. A PTW 30013 0.6cc farmer chamber was placed in plastic water phantoms and measured with different field sizes. The attenuation factors would be calculated and compared between different field sizes and photon energy with paired t-test. The Gafchromic EBT3 films replaced the farmer chamber to perform the attenuation of the compressor in 2D. Results: In phantom attenuation measurements, there were no attenuation effects in gantry angle 300° to 60° (posterior). In gantry angle 165° to 195° (anterior), the mean attenuations were 25.17% vs 20.21% (in 6 MV vs 10 MV) in smaller field size 10 x 10 cm^2, and 23.53% vs 19.20% in larger field size. In the other gantry angles, the mean attenuations were 9.51% vs 7.31% (in 6 MV vs 10 MV) in smaller field size, and 8.57% vs 6.84% in larger field size. In larger field size and higher photon energy, the attenuation factors were significantly decrease (p＜ 0.01).The largest attenuation of the compressor was in diameter 1cm of beam center, that is the position of the screw. The attenuation due to the respiratory suppression plate was lower than the attenuation of the screw, but it should also be concerned. Conclusions: The attenuation effects were decrease when measured with higher energy, larger field size. Therefore, CFRCB can control and decrease the respiratory motions efficiently and comfortably, but the attenuation effect should be considered. When the tumor targets are blocked by CFRCB, the CFRCB should not be used in treatment or the attenuation effects must be calculated by the planning system.',\n",

Finally, the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor compressed the left sciatic nerve and developed intractable limb pain, and the patient passed away with cachexia.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The aim of the study is to investigate the correlation between hemoglobin level during chemoradiation therapy and overall survival in nasopharyngeal cancer. Materials and Methods: Between December 2006 and March 2010, patients with nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal cancer were enrolled. Radiation consisted of at least 70 Gy to the planning target volumes of primary tumor plus any positive nodal disease using 1.8 Gy to 2.0 Gy per fraction. Most patients (79.7%) received concurrent cisplatinbased chemotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy regimens, EP-HDFL, consisted of Epirubicin, Cisplatin, 5-FU, and Leucovorin. Concurrent chemotherapy, PFL, consisted of Cisplatin, 5-FU, and Leucovorin. Weekly hemoglobin levels during induction chemotherapy and/or concurrent chemoradiation therapy were checked for evaluation of hematological effects. Results: Total 64 patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 56 months. AJCC stage III and IV predicted worse 5-year overall survival rates, 88.5% and 58.3%, respectively. Both grade 2 anemia in induction chemotherapy and grade 3 anemia in concurrent chemotherapy correlated with worse 5-year overall survival rates, 50.0% and 50.0%, respectively. No grade 4 or 5 anemia occurred in this study. The effect of anemia had a trend toward significance in univariate analysis. Conclusion: Besides AJCC staging, weekly hemoglobin levels during induction chemotherapy and/or concurrent chemoradiation therapy is a potentially clinical predictor of long-term treatment outcome in nasopharyngeal cancer.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To compare the treatment results of different radiotherapy protocols for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Materials and Methods: Between February 1995 and September 2012, 65 patients with GBM who treated with maximal surgical resection, followed by different external radiotherapy (RT) protocols were evaluated retrospectively. 27 patients (group 1) had received CCRT (concurrent chemoradiotherapy) with temozolomide (TMZ) administered orally at 75 mg/m^2 body surface area (BSA) daily from the first to the last day with local RT (6000 cGy/30 fractions), followed by adjuvant TMZ (150 to 200 mg/m^2 BSA, 5-day dosing and 23 days non-treatment) till the patient's death or progressive disease occurred. 24 patients (group 2) had received adjuvant RT alone with 6660-7000 cGy/33-35 fractions. 14 patients (group 3) had received field-in-field (FIF) boost protocol with RT consisted of daily fractions of 180 cGy to brain tumor site, followed by subsequently 70 cGy (total 250 cGy daily) to reduced field of tumor bed with a total dose of 6250-6500 cGy without other chemotherapy permission. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: Median follow-up was 13.6 months (range, 3.6-67.1 months). Median OS and time to progression for 65 patients were 13.3 and 8.2 months, respectively. Median OS of group 1, 2 and 3 were 19.9, 12.6 and 10.4 months, respectively. The group 1 had significantly better OS than both group 2 (p = 0.03) and group 3 (p = 0.04). No significant difference in OS of group 2 and 3 (p = 0.06). Median progression free survival (PFS) did not differ significantly among group 1, 2 and 3 (median PFS: 9.8, 7.2 and 9.7 months, respectively; group 1 vs 2, group 2 vs 3, and group 3 vs 1, p = 0.09, 0.90 and 0.80, respectively). Patient ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status), GTR (gross tumor resection) or not and RT protocol were significantly correlated with overall survival on both univariate and multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Three independent predictors of survival were identified in our studies: ECOG PS, GTR or not and RT protocol. When independent prognostic factors were examined, advantageous median OS was found out for the patients whose ECOG PS were ≤ 2 and who had GTR, followed by TMZ during and after conventional RT (6000 cGy/30 fractions).\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treated with image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery using volumetric modulated arc therapy. Material and Methods: From March 2010 through November 2012, there were 20 patients with brain AVM treated with image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery in our institution. The median age at diagnosis was 40 years (ranged from 9 to 74 years). Fourteen patients were male (70%) and 6 were female (30%). Among all these 20 patients, 5 patients (25%) had previous surgery of craniotomy with excision, and 2 patients (10%) received previous endovascular embolization. No patients had been managed with observation only at the time of diagnosis. The median dose of stereotactic radiosurgery was 18 Gy (ranged from 12 to 20 Gy). The median clinical target volume was 3.6 c.c (ranged from 1.5 to 15.5 c.c). Results: The median follow-up period was 11.8 months (ranged from 4.7 to 35.4 months). Four patients (20%) had complete obliteration, 8 patients (40%) had partial obliteration, while 8 patients (40%) had stable diseases after treatments. The actuarial 1-year, 2-year and 3-year obliteration rates were 40%, 55% and 60%, respectively. Conclusion: The therapeutic effects of brain AVM treated with image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery using volumetric modulated arc therapy achieved 60% of both complete and partial obliteration rate within the median follow-up period of 11.8 months. The actuarial 1-year, 2-year and 3-year obliteration rates were 40%, 55% and 60%, respectively. The long-term follow-up duration should be warranted to evaluate the further treatment results.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathologic features and treatment modalities, including radiotherapy (RT) alone and induction chemotherapy followed by RT (CRT), and the clinical outcomes of intracranial germinoma. Methods and Materials: A total of 20 patients diagnosed with tissue-confirmed intracranial germinoma between 2006 and 2012 and available follow-up data were included in this study. Sixteen patients underwent CRT and 4 underwent RT alone. CRT involved one to five cycles of upfront chemotherapy followed by limited-field (whole ventricle plus primary tumor boost) or extended-field RT (craniospinal irradiation [CSI] followed by limited-field), for which the RT field and dose depended on the tumor location, response to chemotherapy, and metastatic status. Among them, 13 patients received limited or extended-field RT with 3-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), and 7 patients received CSI accompanied by helical tomotherapy. Results: This study consisted of 18 male and 2 female patients, with a median age of 14 years (7-29 y). After a median follow-up of 34 months, the 3-year disease-free survival rate and overall survival (OS) rate were 90% and 100%, respectively. For the RT alone group, the CSI was delivered with a tumor dose of 30.6 Gy in fractions of 1.8 Gy/d, whole-ventricle and neurohypophysis involved administering 30 Gy in fractions of 2 Gy/d if no CSI was used. Finally, the tumor was boosted to receive a total median dose of 50 Gy (46.5-50.4 Gy), whereas for the CRT group, the entire brain and/or spine received a median of 24 Gy (21.6-30.6 Gy) in fractions of 1.5-1.8 Gy/d, and the tumor was boosted to a total median dose of 45 Gy (24-50.4 Gy). No recurrences developed in patients treated using extended RT; however, 2 patients treated with CRT, but not with CSI, developed spinal relapse. Conclusion: Our results indicate that induction chemotherapy accompanied by dosereduced and volume-reduced RT resulted in effective disease control and prognosis for intracranial germinoma, including β-HCG secreting germinoma.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: A treatment planning study comparing volumetric arc modulation with RapidArc and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Materials and Methods: For both IMRT and RapidArc, the dose calculations and optimizations were performed using the Eclipse treatment planning system. The plans for IMRT with nine fixed beams were compared against four partial arcs with a single isocenter. All plans were optimized for 6 MV photon beams. The dose prescription was 60 Gy to the planning target volume. For organs at risk, the mean and maximum doses were constrained and additional objectives were set on various volume thresholds. The monitor units (MUs) and delivery time were scored to measure the treatment efficiency. The treatment planning dosimetry scored delivery to the calculation agreement with the passing rate of gamma index. Results: RapidArc and IMRT provided equivalent coverage, the average of maximum dose of CTV for IMRT and RapidArc were 65.78 Gy, 67.09 Gy, respectively. The conformity index (COIN) and homogeneity index (HI) of RapidArc were better than IMRT. Both techniques accomplished objectives on organs at risk with a tendency of RA to improve sparing. The number of MUs was 828 ± 24.75 for RapidArc and 1799 ± 367 for IMRT. Treatment plan delivery time was 4.0 ± 0.71 min for RapidArc and 11.96 ± 1.0 min for IMRT. The agreement between planning and measurement showed the passing rate of gamma index for IMRT of 91.06% and for RapidArc of 92.65%. Conclusion: Compared with IMRT, RapidArc treatment technique can provide similar target coverage and better dose sparing to the organs at risks for MPM patients. RapidArc can also reduce the treatment MU and treatment time more than 50% to prevent the possibility of secondary tumors and uncertainty from daily treatment of involuntary movement.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Field width (FW) and pitch factor (PF) are parameters that influence the quality of treatment plans and beam-on times in Tomotherapy that delivers helical radiation therapy. This study examines the relationship between these parameters and their influence on the quality of treatment plan. Material and Method: Target volumes and organ at risk (OAR) volumes were delineated on a computerized tomography of a cylindrical chess phantom. Maintaining the weightings of each volume, treatment plans were optimized with a different combination of planning parameters (FW = 5, 2,5, 1 cm. PF = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8). Each plan was analyzed for dose distribution, treatment time, homogeneity index, conformity index and ripple effect. Result: For revolutions lasting between 15 and 60 seconds, the increase in treatment time correlated with decreasing field width. The ratio between treatment time with different field widths, when treatment time at 5 cm was 1, 1.8 and 4 times at widths of 2.5 cm and 1 cm respectively. Where change in pitch factor was did not result in change in treatment time. For revolutions under 15 seconds, smaller pitch denotes longer treatment time. The dimension of penumbra increased with increasing width. At pitch factor 0.6, the ripple effect was evident and the homogeneity index was at its worst. Transversely, conformity indices differed non-significantly. Longitudinally, the dose gradient increased with decreasing field width. Doses to OARs were minimized at small pitch and field width. OARs in longitudinal direction had higher median dose. Conclusion: Change in field width could lead to change in treatment time. Treatment time could be shortened with combination of large field width and the pitch value, at expense of increased dose to longitudinal directions. Combination of small field width and small pitch yielded better planning quality, and increase in treatment time.',\n",
       " 'Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the orbit is an uncommon neoplasm. We report a 62-year-old Taiwanese man developed a painless proptosis for 8 years. He underwent tumor resection. By histopathology, mucoepidermoid carcinoma was diagnosed. Owing to the rare incidence, the role of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in the disease control has not been defined. Several episodes of recurrence developed despite repeated surgery in this case. The patient was treated with the adjuvant TomoTherapy afterwards. The results at 2 years image follow up revealed stationary tumor volume state after treatment. Therefore, adjuvant RT could be an option of treatment for recurrent mucoepidermoid carcinoma arising from the eye following surgery.

Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma is rare, encompassing approximately 0.1-0.4 percent of all small cell carcinomas, and has been described in a variety of organs. Small cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract is often found in the urinary bladder, and is extremely rare in the ureter. Case report: A 56-year-old man was admitted with a two-month history of the right flank pain. An abdominal computed tomography demonstrated an infiltrative mass lesion with size of about 8.5 × 7.6 cm in the right pelvis, arising from the right ureter, with severe right hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine for 3 cycles, followed by right side hand-assisted retroneoscopic nephroureterectomy. Then adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiotherapy was given. The chemotherapy regimens were cisplatin and etoposide for 3 cycles. The irradiation course consisted of 64.8 Gy/36 fractions to the tumor bed. Discussion: The most common symptoms of this disease are gross hematuria and flank pain. The staging of this disease is according to small cell carcinoma of the lung. The treatment of ureter small cell carcinoma is not well established. Despite adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, most patients develop metastatic disease resulting in poor prognosis of this disease. Aggressive treatment is warranted to improve the outcome. However, the tolerance of the patients is still needed to be considered.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To report preliminary biochemical outcomes, survival and toxicity for patients with localized prostate cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).Materials and Methods: Between December 2003 and March 2012, eighty-seven patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with IMRT at our institution. Treatment was planned using an inverse-planning method. The beam intensity profiles were delivered by dynamic multileaf collimation. Patients were stratified by prognostic risk groups based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk classification criteria. Biochemical failure was defined using the 2005 ASTRO Phoenix consensus definition of the nadir prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration plus 2 ng/mL. Prescribed dose ranged from 61-78.4 Gy. The median follow-up time was 41 months (range: 10-105 months).Results : The 3-year actuarial biochemical relapse-free survival rates for low, intermediate, high, and very high risk group patients were 100%, 100%, 76.3%, and 88.5%, respectively. The 3- and 5-year actuarial overall survival rates were 92% and 80%. Twenty-five patients (28.7%) developed acute Grade 2 GI toxicity, and no patient experienced acute Grade 3 or greater rectal symptoms. Nineteen patients (21.8%) developed acute Grade 2 genitourinary (GU) symptoms, and one experienced Grade 3 or higher GU toxicity. No patient developed late Grade 2 or greater rectal toxicity. Only three patients (3.5%) experienced late Grade 2 GU toxicity. No late Grade 3 or greater GU complications have been observed.Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the feasibility of IMRT in the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Acute and late rectal toxicities are minimal. Short-term biochemical controls are comparable to published results of IMRT. Based on this favorable outcome, IMRT has become the standard treatment for localized prostate cancer at our institution.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: We present our two-year experience of using moderate deep inspiration breath-hold (mDIBH) with an active breathing control (ABC) device for patients with early-stage breast cancer and dosimetric comparison to evaluate the benefit of mDIBH on the heart, lung, and liver.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and having clinical stage Tis, I, or II disease treated between November 2010 and July 2012. Among the 81 patients included in this study, 24 patients were treated with mDIBH and 57 patients were treated with free breathing. Dosimetric analysis was performed to compare dose distribution in the heart, lung, and liver between the two treatment groups.Results: There was no significant difference in the distribution of stage, tumor site, age, clinical target volume (CTV) V50 and volume of CTV, heart, and liver between the non-ABC and ABC group. For all 81 patients, there was a significantly lower ipsilateral lung V10, ipsilateral lung V20, mean ipsilateral lung dose, whole lung V10, whole lung V20, mean whole lung dose, liver V30, and mean liver dose in the ABC group. For 37 patients with a left-sided breast tumor, significantly lower ipsilateral lung V10, ipsilateral lung V20, mean ipsilateral lung dose, heart V30, heart V40, mean heart dose, and mean liver dose were observed in the ABC group. For 44 patients with a right-sided breast tumor, significantly lower ipsilateral lung V20, mean ipsilateral lung dose, mean heart dose, liver V30, and mean liver dose were observed in the ABC group.Conclusions: For early-stage breast cancer patients, mDIBH reduces not only the heart dose but also the lung and liver doses. The routine integration of mDIBH using an ABC device may decrease radiation-induced toxicity in the heart, lung, and liver.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study was to determine the impact of the body-mass factors on magnitude of setup displacements in patients treated with pelvic intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for gynecological cancer.Methods: Using the alignment data of daily on-line On Board Imaging (OBI) from image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), the clinical data of 22 patients treated with pelvic IMRT for cervical or endometrial cancer was analyzed. Body-mass factors included body weight, body height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist thickness, hip circumference and hip thickness. Setup displacements for each patient were assessed by four components: namely systemic error (SE), and random error (RE), through three translational directions and couch rotation (CR). The median values for the body-mass factors were used as cutoff points to divide the groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to assess the predictive role of these factors for the set-up errors.Results: Population SE and RE were 2.8 mm, 2.6 mm, 2.4 mm and 1.7 mm, 1.4 mm, 1.3 mm in the superior-inferior (SI), anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions, respectively. The SE and RE for rotation (CR) was 0.33 and 0.25 degree. Larger waist circumference (WC) was significantly correlated with greater SI-SE (p = 0.02), and CR-RE (p = 0.013), whereas larger hip circumference (HC) with greater SI-RE (p = 0.045), and CR-RE (p = 0.018). Higher BMI was associated with greater, CR-RE (p = 0.006). Body height correlated with AP-SE (p = 0.036).Conclusions: To reduce setup displacements in women with gynecological cancer requiring pelvic IMRT, the use of on-line IGRT should be recommended for those who have a WC ＞ 80.5 cm or a HC ＞ 88.8 cm, or a BMI ＞22.1 Kg/m^2.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the intrafractional motion errors in patient with prostate cancer received pelvis irradiation during RapidArc radiotherapy.Materials and Methods: A total of eighteen high risk group prostate cancer patients were treated prostate and pelvis lymph nodes by RapidArc radiotherapy then boost dose by Cyberknife. All patients had kV cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) scans in their first three fractions of treatment. During these treatments, the CBCT scans were registered to planning CT simulation images as reference to perform registration procedure based on soft tissue windows matched with clinical tumor volume (CTV). The errors of isocenter position were corrected by couch shifted. The second and third CBCT images were immediately acquired before and after RapidArc treatment. These errors of isocenter position on the left-right (LR), superior–inferior (SI) and anterior–posterior (AP) directions were analyzed retrospectively.Results: Under RapidArc technique with a shortened treatment delivery time (about 3 min), the residual systemic and random errors in pre and post-radiation treatment revealed limited. Based on the paired 2^(nd) and 3^(rd) CBCT images, the intrafractional errors (mean ± SD) in LR-SI-AP directions were -0.4 ± 0.8, -0.2 ± 1.0, 0.1 ± 0.8 mm. No intrafractional error differences in three axes, except borderline significant in LR direction (p= 0.046). Isotropic planning margins created with the linear addition of internal margin to clinical tumor volume was respectively 3.6, 4.4, 4.5 mm in LR-SI-AP axes and 2.5, 3.2, 3.3 mm if generated with quadrature addition.Conclusion: Use of the faster RapidArc technique with accurate kV CBCT images online verification for prostate cancer pelvis radiotherapy, the intrafractional motion errors were limited. These speculated intrafractional errors could be applied to improve the accuracy of radiation delivery and a smaller PTV margin might be adopted.',\n",
       " 'Purposes: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a method for the precise and efficient administration of hypofractionated radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to utilize the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans acquired before treatment for dose reconstruction and hereby to assess target volume coverage during prostate SBRT.Materials and Methods: Three patients with early stage prostate cancer were included in this study. All patients had implanted two golden fiducial markers under transrectal ultrasound for image-guided localization. The rectum and bladder in-house preparation protocols were used in this study. Before each treatment, the patient was first set up with a pair of orthogonal kilovoltage (kV) portal images based on fiducial markers and subsequently adjusted to the treatment position with CBCT for soft tissue alignment. A CBCT image set acquired prior to each treatment for patient positioning was employed for the dose reconstruction calculation. The prescription dose was 37.5 Gy in 5 fractions. The criterion of plan is to satisfy at least the 95% of prescription dose to cover 95% of PTV (V95 greater than 95%).Results: All the patients can meet the V95 greater than 95% criterion if we corrected the patient position base on CBCT image. There was only 86% of all fractions can meet the V95 greater than 95% when the patient position was corrected with kV portal images. For bladder, 86.66% and 60% of all fractions could meet the criteria of V50 of bladder less than 50%, and V100 less than 5 c.c respectively. For rectum, 86.66%, 94%, 60%, and 60% of all fractions could meet the criteria of V50 of rectum less than 50%, V80 less than 20%, V90 less than 10%, and V100 less than 5% respectively. Furthermore, there are less than 5cc of rectum receiving 100% of dose for all cases.Conclusion: The correct dose delivered to the correct location is the most important goal of radiation therapy especially for SBRT. The tighter margin than other conventional treatment was applied to this study. Our results show the CBCT registration provides the opportunity to improve the dose delivery accuracy. Although the dose and volume variations of bladder and rectum still cannot be controlled well even if we used in house special protocols in this study. In conclusion, the margin apply to this study is sufficient to achieve the PTV coverage if applying CBCT base on soft tissue matching for patient position registration. We plan to expend our sample size to get more statistically significant results in near future.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify the difference in the window and level of the CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) image between manual adjustment and Iterative Filter. By Iterative Filter, the best contrast image is displayed immediately and the identification of the material in the CBCT is improved.Materials and Methods: The instrument used in this study is the CBCT image XVI of the Elerkta Synergy linear. Catphan phantom CTP 404 is the material being measured. The gray scale on the monitor is analyzed through Iterative Filter to identify Polystyrene, C8H8, PS and Acrylic in the specimen. The gray scale of different materials showed on the monitor can be analyzed and Iterative Filter, the sesult is also compare with manual adjustment.Results: PS material can be identified visually; therefore, the P value of the Iterative Filter (1.0 × 10^(-13)) and the P value of the manual adjustment (2.5 × 10^(-12)) are trivial. However, because it is more difficult to identify the Acrylic material in the image, the P value of the Iterative Filter (6.88 × 10^(-6)) is significantly better than the P value of the manual adjustment (0.026). The Iterative Filter has better identification.Conclusion: In this study, the manual adjustment to the window and level can not improve the quality of the image. The approach in this study using the Iterative Filter can perfect the chosen image immediately. The image quality in window-level and identification can be improved Iterative Filter Statistic Method and has a better result than that of manual adjustment. The Iterative Filter provides adequate identification and the improvement in the image quality.',\n",
       " 'Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard therapy for patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CCRT is usually associated with various levels of complications due to the dosage of either chemotherapy regimen or radiation; therefore, only patients with good performance status were qualified for this aggressive treatment. Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is well tolerated compared with most chemotherapy regimens in treating NSCLC patients, and there is no need to decrease the dosage of gefitinib when combined with radiotherapy. Induction chemotherapy, although not recommended in the treatment strategy for patients with unresectable NSCLC, may be appropriate for select patients who are most likely to benefit from subsequent CCRT. In this case, we report on an unresectable stage IIIB NSCLC patient, who had failed to two lines of chemotherapy, received gefitinib followed by concurrent target-radiotherapy with complete remission and long-term disease free survival for 2 years. We suggest that patients with unresectable NSCLC should be initially considered to receive induction chemotherapy or target therapy and plan further treatment such as radiotherapy or surgery according to the response.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: To analyze the treatment results and compare overall survival rate after definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with different doses of radiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in a retrospective study. Materials and Methods: This study included 109 patients with histologically confirmed ESCC at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between January 2007 and December 2010. The median age at diagnosis of the patients was 62 years old (range, 34-89 years). Patients who were clinically staged as T2-4, N0-1, M0-1, stage II-IV ESCC received definitive CCRT as the primary treatment, with radiotherapy at 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction and concurrent infusional cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-2 cycles. Radiotherapy was delivered by three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique, with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 45-70 Gy). The overall survival (OS) rates and local recurrence free survival (LRFS) rates were compared between high radiation dose (56-70 Gy, n= 55) group and standard radiation dose (45-55.8 Gy, n= 54) group. Survival analysis was done with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model.Results: Two-year overall survival rate of the high-dose and standard-dose group was 38.0% and 23.2%, respectively. The 2-year OS rate of stage II, III, and IV was 57.9%, 32.8%, and 20.1%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that high dose radiation (≧56 Gy), T classification, M classification, and clinical stage significantly affected overall survival (p= 0.013, 0.016, 0.012, and 0.010, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that high dose radiation ≧56 Gy (p= 0.030) and clinical stage II-III (p= 0.015) were significant predictors of better OS. In the univariate and multivariate analyses of the patients with M0 disease (n= 49), high dose radiation also has a remarkable impact on LRFS (p= 0.020, 0.003, respectively). Conclusion: Our study showed that higher radiation dose (≧56 Gy) significantly improved OS and LRFS in patients with unresectable ESCC who underwent definitive CCRT using 3DCRT or IMRT techniques. Further randomized clinical studies are required to clarify the benefits and side effects of escalated radiation dose in the setting of modern conformal radiotherapy techniques.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To analyze the long-term treatment outcome and various prognostic factors in patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) arising from the head and neck region treated by radiotherapy with or without surgery.Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven patients with previously untreated MEC in the head and neck region who received at least 50 Gy of radiotherapy with or without precedent surgery from June 1984 to May 2009 were enrolled in this study. The relationship between clinical and pathologic characteristics and survival rate was investigatedResults: The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 85.5% and 83.2% respectively. Univariate analysis of OS demonstrated that the parameters which significantly affected survival were the gender (P=0.0005), age (P=0.0008), surgical margin (P=0.0031), treatment modality (P=0.0045), primary tumor site (P=0.0307), and histological grade (P=0.0328). The treatment modality (P=0.0014), surgical margin (P=0.0086), and gender (P=0.0175) were predictive factors of DFSConclusion: In univariate analysis, female gender, free surgical margins, and treatment by surgery plus radiotherapy were favorable prognostic factors in predicting both OS and DFS. Older age, non-parotid origin, and high grade tumor indicated worse OS.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma of the head and neck (EMPHN) is a rare disease. The objective of this study was to review the treatment results of EMPHN patients in a single institution in TaiwanMethods and Materials: The cases of 6 patients (4 males and 2 females) diagnosed at our hospital with EMPHN between 1980 and 2010 were reviewed. The median age of the patients was 64 years (range, 54-79 years). Two patients underwent surgery alone, 2 patients underwent radiotherapy alone, and 2 patients underwent surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. The dose of radiotherapy was 50-50.4 grays (Gy) in 25-28 fractions.Results: The median follow-up duration was 5 years. The primary tumor sites were the nasal cavity (2), paranasal sinuses (2), oropharynx (1), and nasopharynx (1). Local recurrence was observed in 2 patients who underwent surgery alone and local control was achieved in 1 after salvage surgery (no evidence of disease after salvage surgery in the follow up 3 years period). Local control was achieved in 2 patients treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Distant metastasis to the skin and bone without evidence of local recurrence was observed in 2 patients treated with radiotherapy alone. None of the patients progressed to multiple myeloma during follow-up evaluations and no severe radiotherapy-related morbidity was observed. One patient who treated with surgery alone died from recurrent EMPHN within the follow-up duration.Conclusions: Local control of the tumor in the primary site was achieved in 4 patients with EMPHN who underwent radiotherapy alone or adjuvant, although 2 of these patients presented with distant metastasis. According to the review of literature and our results, radiotherapy might be safe and effective for local control of EMPHN.',\n",
       " 'Objective: To investigate the changes of the tumor and salivary gland volumes in intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through 2nd phase of computed tomography (CT) treatment planning.Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled in this study, the primary tumor and neck lymph nodes were treated by IMRT; and formed the plan1 (DVH1), re-planning CT with same position after twenty-two radiation treatments formed the plan2 (DVH2). All target volumes and organs at risk were outlined by the same physician. The physical objective and dose constraints were optimized with same criteria. The data obtained from CT treatment planning and DVH were analyzed. The volumes, weights, and outline changes in the transverse diameter of CT images varied between before and after treatments.Results: Patient weight, volumes of tumors and salivary glands decreased remarkably during radiotherapy. The average weight decreased by 2.97% (2.33 kg, range 1.5~3.7 kg). Compared Plan 1 with Plan 2, the parotid glands was significantly reduced by 15.67% (10.83 cc, 95% CI: range 7.45~14.21 cc), submandibular glands 15.83% (3.39 cc, 95% CI: range 2.14~4.65 cc), GTV decreased 15.49% (3.83 cc, 95% CI: range 2.36~5.30 cc), and GTV-LN decreased 41.81% (15.12 cc, 95% CI: range 8.66~21.57 cc). The transverse diameter of head and neck CT images reduced by average of 0.32 ~ 0.89 cm (1.93%~6.04%), especially at the transverse diameter in the level of 3 cm above the set-up center (0.89 cm). The GTV volume on average shrank 2.23 cc and 6.91 cc as comparing T1-3 with T4 disease (p = 0.0013); The GTV-LN volume shrank on average 8.59 cc, 38.93 cc (P＜ 0.0001) as comparing N1-2 with N3 disease. The transverse diameter changes of head and neck contours were correlated significantly with N stage and body weight loss.Conclusion: For NPC patients treated with IMRT, weight loss, volume reduction of salivary gland, and body contour change are common. The salivary glands on average reduced volume by 15% and GTV-LN by 40% after one-month treatment. The transverse diameter of head and neck regions could decrease up to 0.89 cm. We recommend repeat simulation after one-month of radiotherapy in order to reduce the dose to the normal organs and avoid missing treatment targets.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To analyze and compare the dose distribution characteristic of two radiosurgery treatment devices of Gamma Knife®(GK) and Cyber Knife®(CK), in treating arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and the influence on their clinical application.Material and Method: Ten AVM patients treated with CK of prescribed dose of 20-25 Gy in single fraction were evaluated. Each treatment plan CT images including the contours of the target and the surrounding critical organs were exported and loaded into the GK treatment planning system. GK treatment plan using the same prescribed radiation dose were generated. Dosimetric comparison of the two treatment devices including the conformity, gradient and heterogeneity index, volume of brain tissue covered by 10 Gy and 12 Gy, maximum dose of brain stem and the beam on time. Paired Samples t-test was used to statistical analyze and compare the conformal and gradient index, the dose coverage volume of 10 Gy and 12 Gy in both plans for significance (p value)Result: The conformal index was 0.626 ± 0.106 and 0.795 ± 0.087 in GK and CK, respectively (p = 0.004). The gradient index was 3.082 ± 0.369 and 6.071 ± 1.698 in GK and CK, respectively (p = 0.001). The heterogeneity index was 0.723 ± 0.055 and 0.275 ± 0.045 in GK and CK, respectively. The difference of coverage volume of 10 Gy and 12 Gy were significant (p = 0.025 and 0.022, respectively). For the 3 cases with AVM location adjacent ωthe brainstem, the dose of 1 c.c. and maximum dose of brain stem in GK plan were less than CK. CK had better treatment efficiency due to shorter beam on time.Conclusion: Cyber Knife using inverse treatment planning similar to intensity modulated function had better dose conformity. Gamma Knife should have better normal brain tissue and critical organs protection due to sharp dose fall-off gradient.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of applying VMAT for HNC patients in daily practice by comparing volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for patients with locally advanced head-and-neck cancer (HNC) with regard to the dosimetric parameters and efficiency of delivery.Material & Method: Nine locally advanced HNC patients on either an IMRT or VMAT treatment plan were selected for this study. Another corresponding plan using an alternative technique was generated for comparison. We applied an adaptive strategy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique in all radiation therapy protocols, including an initial plan and a reduced plan with acquisition of CT images about 4 weeks later. The Philips Pinnacle³® Planning System v. 9.0 was adopted for designing all treatment plans. Dosimetric parameters compared between VMAT and IMRT plans included target coverage, dose conformity, dose homogeneity, organs at risk (OAR) sparing, monitor units (MUs) and treatment delivery time.Result: The average number of arc used in the VMAT plan was 2.07 and the number of fields per IMRT plan was 6.5. The VMAT and IMRT plans had similar PTV coverage (V100% ＞ 98% and ＞ 96%, respectively). There was no significant difference between VMAT and IMRT in conformity (CI= 1.73 and 1.63, respectively, p= 0.546), homogeneity of PTV-H (HI= 1.08 and 1.07, respectively, p= 0.387), PTV-M (HI = 1.10 and 1.10, respectively, p= 0.891) and PTV-L (HI = 1.13 and 1.12, respectively, p= 0.369). There were similar dose-volume histogram distributions between these two techniques for most of OARs. No significant difference existed in performance of parotid sparing by using these two techniques. Compared to IMRT, VMAT technique significantly reduced the MUs by 16.1% (757.0 versus 635.4 MUs, p= 0.011) and the average treatment time by 4.2 minutes (8.7 versus 4.5 minutes, p ＜ 0.001).Conclusion: This study demonstrated that equally clinical acceptable dose distributions can be achieved in both VMAT and IMRT techniques for HNC. In addition, VMAT provided faster delivery time and lower executed monitor units. Therefore, it is feasible to apply VMAT for HNC for improving the efficiency without compromising the quality of planning dosimetry.',\n",
       " 'Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, and most commonly seen in the elderly and immunocompromised patients. This is a case report describing our experience with MCC in a male patient who incidentally found a nodule over his right lower thigh. MCC was confirmed by positive cytokeratin 20 expressions in immunohistochemical staining after tumor wide excision. Image studies, including right leg CT, chest mediastinum CT and abdomen to pelvis CT, showed neither regional lymph node involvement nor visceral organ metastases. Due to clinical N0 and prior local excision with free margin, sentinel lymph node biopsy is not performed. The patient received postoperative photon beam RT with 59.4 Gy and 54 Gy to primary tumor bed with 5 cm margin and regional inguinal lymphatic area, respectively. Dry skin desquamation was noted near completion of adjuvant radiotherapy but recovered during follow-up. The patient underwent regular OPD follow-up monthly in the first six months after adjuvant RT and quarterly thereafter. The patient kept disease-free 34 months postoperatively. As no prospective randomized studies exist, the optimum treatment of this disease is limited. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was recommended by NCCN for accurate staging, previous meta-analysis demonstrates local adjuvant RT after complete excision reduced local and regional recurrence.',\n",
       " '”Undifferentiated” uterine sarcoma, or ”high-grade” endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), is a rare neoplasm characterized by early visceral organ dissemination and poor prognosis. We present a case of a 48-year-old woman with ”undifferentiated” uterine sarcoma. She was treated and staged by surgery with adjuvant pelvic irradiation. Metastases of left supraclavicular fossa (SCF) and axillary nodes developed 5 and 9 months after the surgery. Salvage radiotherapy alone was delivered to left SCF region. Furthermore, axillary nodal dissection followed by local radiotherapy was done for left axillary Iymphadenopathies. She is alive without evidence of disease and doing well 64 months after the diagnosis of uterine sarcoma. In conclusion, isolated SCF and axillary lymph node metastases are unusual sites of relapse for ”undifferentiated” uterine sarcoma. Aggressive radiotherapy with or without surgery may achieve longer survival for such patients with oligometastases of distant nodes.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate our relative large institutional experience of the clinical-pathologic features and outcomes of radiation therapy in patients with operable primary breast cancer.Materials and Methods: We reviewed 1,623 consecutive patients with operable breast cancers which received complete course of adjuvant radiation therapy at our institution between 1988 and 2009. All patients underwent either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (BCS) as part of their treatment. Clinical-pathologic and outcome parameters were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to estimate loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards models were performed to assess the prognostic significance of these clinicalpathologic parameters on LRFS.Results: The median follow-up was 6.1 years (range, 2.3 months - 23.0 years). Among these 1623 patients, a total of 83 (5.1%) patients developed loco-regional recurrences, which occurred at 4.7 months to 12.5 years (mean, 2.0 years) after surgery. The 5-year LRFS, MFS, DFS and OS were 95.1%, 83.5%, 79.8%, 85.4% respectively for the entire cohort. Multivariate analyses showed that patients with advanced T stage, nodes positive, HER2 positive or triple negative tumors (ie, ER negative, PR negative and HER2 negative) had poor prognosis on LRFS (all P ＜ 0.05). For 39 patients with initial stage IV breast cancer and receiving post-operation adjuvant radiotherapy, the 5-year loco-regional control rate was 89.9%.Conclusions: Our results are consistent with others that radiation therapy is a very effective adjuvant treatment on loco-regional control in breast cancer patients. Triplenegative and HER2-positive profiles are prognostic markers for loco-regional recurrence. Aggressive local therapy improves local control in metastatic breast cancer.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the treatment outcome following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer and the impact of tumor regression and post operative nodal status.Materials and Methods: Sixty-four patients of esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy from June, 1999 to April, 2011 were followed retrospectively. Tumor regression grade (TRG), post operative nodal status, pathologic stage, pattern of recurrence and overall survival (OS) of these patients were recorded and analyzed. Disease-free and overall survival rates were calculated with Kaplan-Meier method and group comparisons were based on the log-rank test. Cox regression analysis was the method applied when several factors were assessed simultaneously.Results: Median survival is 24.2 months (range, 3-92 months). Comparing TRG 1 with TRG 2-4, the OS was not significantly different (P = 0.549). When TRG1-2 was compared with TRG3-4, there was a trend of significant difference in OS (P = 0.089). The median survival was 23.6 months in the N- group, compared with 13.5 months in the N+ group (P ＜ 0.001). In univariate survival analysis, N+ (P ＜ 0.001) and vascular involvement (P = 0.041) significantly influence survival probabilities. N+ was significantly (P = 0.001) associated with distant metastasis and TRG 3-4 (P = 0.008) with locoregional recurrence. By multivariate analysis, only N+ significantly influence OS (P = 0.004) and vascular involvement (P = 0.658) was not significant.Conclusion: For those who are receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, achieving node-negative status is a significant prognostic factor for the outcome. As for histomorphologic tumor regression, it has a less predictive factor.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Radiosurgery plays an important role in treating patients with intraocular tumor and retained visual function aiming at organ-conservation. Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKRS) provides a relatively non-invasive and less time-consuming procedure for treating patients with choroidal melanoma comparing with plaque brachytherapy. It also has the potential radiosurgery to provide effective treatment for other ophthalmologic indication. We presented a new treatment protocol using GKRS to treat patient with intraocular tumor and evaluated the safety and precision of GKRS as a primary treatment for intraocular tumor.Methods: Two patients with uveal melanoma and one patient with breast cancer orbital metastasis treated with the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion stereotactic radiosurgery in our hospital. Retrobulbar anesthesia following fixation of the treated eye by suturing two extraocular muscles to the stereotactic frame were performed in order to immobilize the eye in the whole treatment procedure. The dose to the tumor margin was 25-30 Gy prescribed at 50-55% isodose line. Contrast-enhanced MRI was used for Gamma Plan dose planning. CT scans were done after eye fixation, immediate before and after the GKRS to confirm the accuracy of tumor localization. We compared tumor volume, tumor and lens gravity point deviation, and tumor coverage in the 3 sets of CT scans to check the precision of immobilization and eye fixation.Results: The eye movement analysis revealed that the gravity point coordination deviation of the tumor and lens between CT-1 and CT-2, or CT-1 and CT-3 was less than 0.120 mm. At least 95% of the tumor volume was covered by the prescription dose in the 3 sets of CT image. After GKRS, tumor shrinkage and serous retinal detachments disappearance were noted by ophthalmoscopy and orbital MRI in two patients. No major complication was found during follow up.Conclusion: GKRS using our treatment protocol is a relatively non-invasive, organconserving, and less time-consuming single fraction treatment for intraocular tumor. Our eye fixation method reveals high accuracy. Larger study with long term follow up is needed to evaluate the dose response result of the patients.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study wants to establish a prognostic prediction system by artificial neural network for individual patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Materials and methods: In this study, the dataset are 1,114 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in one cancer center during the year from 1990 to 2005. The chosen variables include age, sex, primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, biopsy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, lactic dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, smoking, and family history. The final dataset are 984 patients excluding 70 patients with any data columns missing and 60 patients with distant metastasis. Seventy-five percent of 984 patients are randomly selected and classified to training group. An artificial neural network is created by computer software to predict the five-year survival status of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The performance of prediction models will be evaluated according to parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve.Result: The average age of the patients is 45.45 years old, and the five-year overall survival rate is 77.74%. The optimized artificial neural network is MLP 34-5-2 which training performance is 92.00 and test performance is 87.80. Its accuracy is 90.96%, sensitivity is 93.73%, specificity is 81.27%, and area under the ROC curve is 0.95 for all patients. Its accuracy is 87.80%, sensitivity is 92.23%, specificity is 71.70%, and area under the ROC curve is 0.88 for test group.Conclusion: This study shows that the prognostic prediction system established by artificial neural network has the potential to predict the five-year survival status of individual patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. With more input data, the performance of prediction models is better than previous researches. But this prognostic prediction system still need further study to prove it could be used for clinical patients.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To verify the accuracy of the clinical reference dosimetry according to the TG-21 protocol using seven solid phantoms for high energy photon and electron beams.Materials and Methods: The TG-21 protocol was published in 1983, and then the clinical reference dosimetry can be performed in the solid phantom materials. However, only acrylic and clear polystyrene are supported in TG-21. Reference dosimetry followed by TG-21 but use solid phantoms other than the phantoms supported by this protocol can result uncertainties in absolute dose calibration. Plastic Water® Phantom Material (PSW), Standard Grade Solid Water® (GSW), Virtual Water^TM Phantom Materials (VSW), RW3 solid water phantom (RW3), white polystyrene phantom (Wpoly), acrylic phantom (Acry) and clear polystyrene phantom (Cpoly) are enrolled to compare the responses with water for 6, 10 and 15 MV photon beams and 6, 9, 12 and 15 MeV electron beams. For the RW3 and Wpoly, we compare the results using the water and clear polystyrene parameters for clinical absolute dosimetry calculation. Ionization measurements were taken at water equivalent depths of 5 cm and dmax for photon and electron beams, respectively. The phantom dose conversion factor (PDCF) of the absolute dose between solid water phantoms and water at the identical calibration conditions are obtained. Additionally, comparisons for percent depth doses at water equivalent depths of 5, 10, and 15 cm in photon beams, and d50 and d80 in electron beams were performed to verify the different response at different depths.Results: The variations between five solid water phantoms and water for photon beams are all within 1.0%. For PSW and Acry, the variations in electron beams are within 1.0%. However, the variations are -0.6 to -3.6% for 6 to 15 MeV electron beams for GSW, VSW, RW3, Wploy and Cpoly. The PDCF of 0.994~ 0.964 for electron beams are obtained. The variations of PDD (5 cm), PDD (10 cm), PDD (15 cm) between five solid water phantoms and water for photon beams are within 1.1%. The variations of d50 and d80 between five solid water phantoms and water for photon beams are within 1.5 mm.Conclusion: The PSW、GSW、VSW、RW3、Wpoly solid water phantom can be treated as water for 6, 10 and 15 MV photon beams. And the PSW can also be treated as water for electron beams. For electron beam dose calibration, PDCF should be applied for GSW, VSW, RW3 and Wpoly. Phantom response relative to water should be evaluated carefully when TG-21 protocol is used for clinical dose calibration.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: High dose rate (HDR) remote afterloading brachytherapy is the most common methods used for brachytherapy. Most hospitals in Taiwan used the Nucletron microSelectron system with 10 Ci 192Ir source for brachytherapy. The theory of dose calculation of Nucletron microSelectron system was based on TG-43. The aim of this study was to compare the result of TLD measurement the calculation results using the Sievert integral and TG-43.Material and Method: The TLDs and Varian 2100C LINAC were used to build the calibration curve. The selected TLD and needle applicator were put in the special positions in solid water phantom. The result of measurement was compared with Sievert integral and TG-43.Result: The variation between the result of measurement and calculation with TG-43 are in 8%, but the result of calculation with Sievert integral have large variation up to 22% between the others, especial in the region near source. The differences between three methods were decreased with large radial distances.Conclusion: The variation between the result of measurement and calculation with TG-43 were within 8%. The underestimate of dose for Sievert integral might be due to the oblique scatting, and the influence of oblique scatting would be decreased with the increasing of radial distance. The most contribution of error in this study might be come from the shift of TLD positions and the brachytherapy source position.',\n",
       " 'Primary breast osteosarcoma is an aggressive and relatively rare tumour with poor prognosis. It is associated with early recurrence and hematogenous rather than lymphatic spread, most commonly to the lungs. We report a case in a 32-year-old woman who presented with a hard painless lump at left breast of six years duration. Left side nipple sparing mastectomy including axillary lymph node dissection was carried out. The tumor was 10 x 9.5 x 6 cm in size. Histopathology of the nipple sparing mastectomy specimen showed predominantly osteosarcomatous areas. Immunohistochemistry indicated that neoplastic osteoblastic cells of the tumor stained positively for vimentin, but negatively for epithelial markers; which suggested. Immunohistochemistry plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of this type of tumor. Because there was no evidence of metastasis and residual tumoral cell was present at the base of site of surgery, she received adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. But she remained disease free at 15 months at which time metastases of bone and lung were diagnosed.',\n",
       " \"An 85-year-old man who had artificial pacemaker implantation was diagnosed to have esophageal cancer. The patient was ineligible for surgery or chemotherapy as the agreement of multidisciplinary tumor board. So radiotherapy alone was planned. The location of tumor is very close to the lead of pacemaker. Thus, the pacemaker absorbed high dose of radiation inevitably although the published literature strongly suggested that the pacemaker should not be in the direct field or absorb radiation dose higher than 200 cGy. Under close cooperation between the radiation oncologist and the cardiologist, the patient underwent the radiotherapy smoothly. The prescribed dose was 6000 cGy to tumor and 5777 cGy to pacemaker. The tumor got complete remission and no malfunction of pacemaker was noted at three months' follow up. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in Taiwan to demonstrate how to successfully use radiotherapy to treat a cancer patient with pacemaker implantation under the close cooperation of radiation oncologist and cardiologist.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: This retrospective study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors influenced the overall and progression-free survival (PFS) in cervical cancer patients who received radical hysterectomy and Iymphadenectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy.Methods: From 2000 to 2006, there were 149 cervical cancer patients treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy in the Department of Radiation therapy, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan. Patient characteristics, treatment characteristics and pathologic factors were analyzed using log rank test. The overall survival (OS) and PFS distribution were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed by the Cox regression model.Result: The median age of this population was 55 years-old (ranged from 25 to 82). There were 102, 33, and 14 patients belonged to FIGO stage 18, IIA and 118 to IVA, respectively. The 5-year OS and PFS were 75.2% and 65.4% in stage 18 cervical cancer, 69.7% and 70.5% in stage IIA cervical cancer, and 66.7% and 50% in stage 118. IVA cervical cancer. In multivariate analysis, the factors of adenocarcinoma (p ＜0.05) and parametrial invasion (p ＜ 0.01) correlated with worse OS and the factors of parametrial invasion (p ＜0.01) and age ＜60 (p ＜0.05) correlated with worse PFS.Conclusion: Parametrial invasion and histology of adenocarcinoma accounted the most important prognostic factors among other clinical and pathological factors in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy didn't achieve better survival in our study.\",\n",
       " 'Introduction : To retrospectively evaluate Hypofractionated Tomotherapy (HT) on the treatment of intrathoracic lesions in patients with stage IV non-small celllung cancer (NSCLC).Material and Methods: Between April 2007 and July 2011, 27 stage IV NSCLC patients were treated with HT for their intrathoracic lesions. The number of intrathocic lesions was ≦ 5 and none of them exceeded 5 cm in greatest dimension. Overall survival, rate of in-field recurrence and incidence of radiation pneumonitis were analyzed. Megavoltage computerized tomography (MVCT) was utilized for tumor contouring. The mean radiation dose per fraction was 4.7±0.3 Gy (mean±standard deviation) and the number of fractions ranged between 9 and 16 (median: 10 fractions). Total irradiation dose was 48.8±6.8 Gy.Results: The median follow-up period was 16.1 months. There was no in-field failure. The median duration of overall survival was 11.2 months among patients with extrapulmonary disease (EPD) and 38.6 months among patients without EPD (p = 0.03). The median duration of overall survival was 34.7 months among patients with ＜ 3 intrathoracic GTV s and 32.1 months among patients with 3-5 intrathoracic GTVs (p = 0.57). The aggregated intrathoracic GTV in each patient averaged 39.18±39.98 cm3. The median duration of overall survival was 38.6 months among patients with aggregated intrathoracic GTV ≦27.89 cm^3 and 12.3 months among patients with aggregated intrathothoracic GTV ＞ 27.89 cm^3 (p= 0.04). Two patients developed grade 3 or greater radiation pneumomhs.Conclusion: HT may be feasible for selected stage IV NSCLC patients with the number of intrathoracic lesions less than or equal to 5. Excellent local control can be anticipated. Presence of EPD and volume of intrathoracic lesions may be significant prognostic factors for overall survival.',\n",
       " 'Backaround and Purpose: To investigate the impact of supine position versus prone position with belly-board on prostate radiotherapy by evaluation the geometric parameter change between internal organs and treatment dose-volume histograms (DVHs).Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with prostate cancer underwent pelvic CT scan in position of both prone with belly-board device and supine without immobilization. Four-field box three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) treatment planning was planned for each patient in both positions. Geometric change including diameter of rectum, distant between critical organs and treatment DVHs were investigated. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis.Results: Patients in prone treatment position had both larger anterio-posterior diameters and transverse diameter of rectum (p = 0.003 and p = 0.031), and larger distance between the centers of prostate and rectum (p=0.002) than those of patients in supine position. In regard to the DVHs data, prone treatment position resulted in larger rectal volume (p = 0.015), lower mean rectal dose (p = 0.002) and smaller rectal volume receiving high radiation dose (p = 0.001).Conclusions: Patients in prone treatment position with belly-board immobilization had both larger anterio-posterior diameters, transverse diameter of rectum, and larger distance between the centers of prostate and rectum than those of patients in supine position. Prone treatment position with belly-board device can reduce rectum dose, which may in turn decrease the risk of radiation-induced complications.',\n",
       " \"Objectives/Hypothesis: To compare setup reproducibility, comfort level and hardness perceived by the patients between two head suports employed in the same immobilization system in head-and neck radiotherapy. Additionally, the relationship between setup accuracy and patient comfort survey was also investigated.Methods: Between March 2011 and February 2012, there were 35 patients undergoing head-and-neck radiotherapy (RT) being recruited and all studied patients received the same immobilization device (a standard thermoplastic head-and-shoulder mask, Type S mask) twice, in which two different head supports were employed. Both a TIMO support and a Silverman support were used to compare setup accuracy/precision with several types of measurement respectively in each studied patient. All patients underwent planning computed tomography (CT). A series of on-board images (OBIs) were taken at the start, during, and by the end of the radiotherapy course in each studied patient. The OBI images were subsequently co-registered and repositioning accuracy was examined by recording displacement including three axes at the isocenter and orthogonal planes. Furthermore, the patients' subjective perception of comfort level, hardness, and preference for selecting between the two head supports were analyzed and compared. Last but not least, we attempted to explore the association between repositioning accuracy represented by several indicators and the patients' subjective perception in terms of comfort level and hardness.Results: A total of 351 OBI data sets were analyzed. Although the absolute difference was quite small between the two head supports (TIMO support vs. Silverman support) with regard to three displacement errors, total vector displacement errors, spine curve, and mandible angle, it was noted that Silverman support was associated with more limited repositioning displacement in the anteroposterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions (paired t-test, p= 0.011, 0.004, respectively). As the RT course was proceeding, a trend was noted toward a greater variation in both spinal curve and mandible angle, suggesting that reproducibility should be paid more attention when the RT course moves forward. In the comfort survey, perception of hardness was positively correlated with comfort level in both head supports with weak but significant significance (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.387, p ＜0.001). As for the association between repositioning accuracy and repositioning accuracy and comfort survey, although there was no any correlation between hardness of head supports and repositioning accuracy, comfort level was positively correlated with repositioning displacement in rotation (Pearson's correlation coefficient =0.213, P ＜0.001) and total vector displacement error (Pearson's correlation coefficient =0.153, p= 0.006) in Silverman head support only.Conclusions: The results of the current study have demonstrated that the available immobilization system equipped with either TIMO head support or a Silverman head support provides satisfactory and nearIy equivalent repositioning-related outcomes. More limited repositioning displacement is positively associated with more satisfactory perception of comfort level exclusively in the immobilization system equipped with Silverman head support. In the future, we might consider leaving the choice between the two different head supports to the individual patient according to subjective perception of comfort level.\",\n",
       " 'Quality of cancer treatment depends on coordination, communication, cooperation and collaboration of multidisciplinary team. Multidisciplinary team conferences are forums for cancer treatment providers to discuss of the diagnosis, prospective treatment policy and recommendation of management, caring and nursing for a cancer patient. The implementation of multidisciplinary team conferences aims for improving the quality of cancer care. Improvement in quality of multidisciplinary team conferences is also required. However, a practice standard of multidisciplinary team conferences is not well-established in Taiwan. In this study, we described the definition, content and composition, advantages and facilitators of multidisciplinary team conferences for cancer patients. Furthermore, the role and responsibility of multidisciplinary team members were identified. In addition, we discussed and explored the dilemmas and further perspectives of multidisciplinary team conferences. Results would enhance our understanding in the impact of the multidisciplinary team conferences.

       " \"Purpose: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has become a standard radiation delivery technique for many types of cancers such as prostate, head and neck and breast. The dosage was not precise in step-and-shoot IMRT, while the radiation delivered with higher dose rate or lower dose per segment. The phenomenon is overshoot effect. It causes the higher dose at the first segment and lower dose at the last segment. The purposes are that exam the dosimetric accuracy with overshoot effect, and improve the accuracy with corrections.Materials and Method's: There are two parts in the study. The first part is to exam the overshoot with the dose rates, from 100 MU/min to 600 MU/min, and segment dose, from 1 MU per segment (MUI seg) to 10 MU/seg. The second part is to correct and measure the overshoot effect with block correct, interlace correct and index correct.Result : The overshoot effect cause higher dose at the first segment and lower dose at the last segment with higher dose rate and lower dose per segment. While the dose per segment is 1 MU and the dose rate is 600 MU/min, the dosimetric error is up to 52.5%. The three corrections improved dosimetric accuracy with the overshoot effect. Block correct, interlace correct and index correct reduce the dose from 152.5% to 98.7%, 93.4% and 100.1 %, repectively.Conclusion: Clinically, it is possible to reduce the overshoot effect with with lower dose per segment and higher dose rate. The three corrections improve the dosimetric accuracy for overshoot effect.\",\n",

       " 'Purpose: Thymic carcinoma is an uncommon but lethal malignancy. We analyze the outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with advanced thymic carcinoma treated at a single institution.Materials and Methods: The records of 18 patients with histologically confirmed thymic carcinoma treated between April 1996 and April 2012 at Tri-Service General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical resection was performed in 9 patients, including 3 patients who received preoperative therapy and postoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, 5 who received postoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy and 1 who received postoperative radiotherapy alone. Eight patients had tumor which were unresectable or medically inoperable and underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone. One patient died 2 months after diagnosis without any cancer treatment. Radiotherapy was delivered with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy using Cyberknife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The median dose of radiotherapy was 63 Gy. Most (93.3%) of the chemotherapy regimen contained cisplatin.Results: The distribution of Masaoka stage at presentation was III in 7 patients, IVA in 4 patients and IVB in 7 patients. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate were 46.5% and 32.1%, respectively. The 5-year in-field tumor control rate of 17 patients who underwent radiotherapy was80.9%. Univariate statistical analysis revealed that radiotherapy ≧ 65 Gy was the only statistically significant predictor of outcome. A total radiation dose of ≧ 65 Gy results in improved 3-year OS (100% vs. 13.1%, p= 0.004) and 3-year PFS (47.6% vs. 16%, p=0.044) in patients with thymic carcinoma. The survival benefit of receiving radiotherapy ≧ 65 Gy was apparent in the unresected group of patients with thymic carcinoma.Conclusions: Aggressive multidisciplinary treatments including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, are helpful in treating advanced thymic carcinoma. Radiotherapy with dose above 65 Gy may improve the OS and PFS of patients with advanced thymic carcinoma, especially in the unresected group.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the toxicity and treatment response of using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and chemotherapy as neoadjvuant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for rectal cancer.Materials and Methods: Ten patients with stage IIA-IV rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant CCRT using prone-position VMAT from April 2010 to December 2010 were enrolled in this study. All patients were treated on a belly board with a full bladder. All VMAT plans were designed with the Pinnacle3 9.0 planning system with 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Setup errors were corrected using cone-beam computed tomography weekly or more frequently. Treatment toxicities were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. The chemotherapy regimens were 5-fluorouracil-based, combined with oxaliplatin or mitomycin. Five patients received bevacizumab as a part of the chemotherapy regimen.Results: All patients completed neoadjuvant CCRT and received post-CCRT surgical resection. Two had pathological complete response (pCR), and both of these received bevacizumab. Nine of 10 patients had T or N downstaging. Only one patient had pathological nodal involvement. The most common toxicities were grade 1 or 2 anal skin reaction and diarrhea. No patient experienced more than grade 3 toxicity. There was no difference in toxicity between patients with or without bevacizumab. The average displacement in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical directions in the whole group was 0.24 cm, 0.21 cm, and 0.37 cm, respectively. The standard deviation of displacement at longitudinal, lateral, and vertical directions ranged from 0.09-0.34 cm, 0.06-0.20 cm, and 0.11-0.52 cm, respectively.Conclusions: Using VMAT and prone position on a belly board in neoadjuvant CCRT with or without bevacizumab for rectal cancer is feasible and safe. The treatmentrelated toxicity was acceptable and the treatment response was satisfactory. Proneposition technique requires more attention in setup errors.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To compare the dosimetric advantage of helical tomotherapy (HT) over intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) and sliding window intensity-modulated radiation therapy (SW-IMRT) for total scalp irradiation.Methods: Three treatment plans (SW-IMRT, IMAT and HT) were generated for a 73 year-old man with scalp angiosarcoma undergoing IMRT. The doses to the planning target volume (PTV) were 50 Gy. Conformity indexes, doses to the brain and lens, number of monitor units (MU), and treatment times were compared between techniques. Plan verification using a phantom study was also performed to compare the radiation planning results.Results: The coverage factors of the PTV and homogeneous index were 0.99/1.10 for SW-IMRT, 0.95/1.14 for IMAT, and 0.99/1.04 for HT. The conformation numbers for the three plans were 0.74, 0.74, and 0.69, respectively. The proportions of normal brain receiving above 30 Gy/40 Gy were 43.8%/10.4% for IMRT, 40.7%/18.5% for IMAT and 20.6%/7.4% for HT. Although IMAT showed no superior dosimetric advantage over SW-IMRT, a lower number of MUs and a shorter treatment time were needed for IMAT. The phantom study had similar dosimetric results.Conclusion: For patients receiving total scalp irradiation, these three techniques provide comparable target coverage. HT spares the brain better than IMAT and SW-IMRT.',\n",

Superficial doses at hypothetical neck lymphatic regions were measured with IMRT head/neck phantom and anthropomorphic Rando phantom. Seven-field IMRT plans with a prescribed dose of 180 cGy were designed using an Eclipse treatment planning system. Two different geometric phantoms were used to measure the absolute dose for two measured tools.Result: In this experiment the variance coefficient of ultrathin TLD was within 3%. The reading values and delivered doses were in a good linear relationship. The points on calibration curve of Gafchromic film were within 1% and in a stable performance. The mean surface measured doses for simulated phantoms with tumor 3 mm shrinkage within 5%. The mean surface measured doses for EBT film and ultrathin TLD with a prescribed dose of 180 cGy were 93.25 cGy~104.66 cGy and 93.99 cGy~103.72 cGy on right side neck of IMRT head/neck phantom, 99.57 cGy~113.91 cGy and 99.77 cGy~116.85 cGy on left side neck of IMRT head/neck phantom, respectively. The mean surface measured doses for EBT film and ultrathin TLD were 99.39 cGy~122.49 cGy and 104.43 cGy~120.97 cGy on right side neck of Rando® phantom, 114.54 cGy~125.02 cGy and 113.15 cGy~121.80 cGy on left side neck of Rando® phantom, respectively.Conclusion and Discussion: From the experimental results, ultrathin TLD and EBT film can be adopted as the measured tools for surface dose. The future work for this research could gather statistics of the skin reactions indeed affected by the skin dose received from radiation for clinical applications. To evaluate severity of skin reaction and measure most accurate skin dose, and this data can be used references for skin reaction gradings.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of dose delivery in IMRT and VMAT.Method and Materials: The PTW 2D-ARRAY consists of 729 vented ionization chambers with a dedicated phantom called Octavius were used to acquire the 2D dose distributions for the IMRT and VMAT plans. One limitation of the PTW 2D-ARRAY is the significant angular dependency, so we had measured the correction factors for VMAT plans. Another dosimetry system consists of a farmer type ion chamber (Wellhofer FC-65P) and solid water phantom was used to measure the selected point dose. Total of 19 IMRT and 8 VMAT plans were included in this study. IMRT plans were verified with perpendicular deliveries at 0 degree gantry angle. VMAT plans were measured with actual treatment arcs, and then the corrections were applied after the measurements. We performed gamma comparison with 3% and 3mm criteria to evaluate the results of all 2D dose maps.Results: The significant angular dependences of PTW 2D-ARRAY were showed at the measured gantry angle between 90 to 270 degrees, especially at both 90 and 270 degrees, which was parallel with the measured plane of PTW 2D-ARRAY. The gamma factors of the gantry angle 90 and 270 were 13.1% and 22.3% for 6 MV photon beam and 31.7% and 37.2% for 10 MV photon beam.The mean point doses variation between each measurements and treatment plans in all IMRT/VMAT QA was -1.0% +/-1.0 % (mean +/- std). The mean gamma factor of IMRT QA was 98.3%+/- 2.1%. And the mean gamma factor in the full-arc VMAT QA was 95.6+/-2.6% after applied acorrection factor range from 1.007 to 1.040. Therefore, the 2D dose maps showed great agreements in all IMRT/VMAT QA.Conclusions: PTW 2D-ARRAY has better performance in static angle IMRT, but has limitations caused by angular dependences in VMAT QA. We suggest a correction factor should be applied to every measured points of 2D dose maps when using PTW 2D-ARRAY for a full-arc VMAT QA.',\n",

For the purpose of calibration, a set of integrated images for open and transmission fields of different field sizes are acquired and consequently imported into Epiqa together with the output factor table to establish basic algorithm configuration data. A calibration factor can then be determined for every pixel of EPID images by weighting the contribution of primary and transmitted radiation. The pixel based calibration relates the readout of a pixel to a dose at the depth of dmax in water equivalent homogenous medium. By applying the conversion factors to all pixels of the EPID images, a planar dose distribution at the dmax in water is obtained. A total of 20 patients (70 arcs in total) were included in this study, 7 with prostate cancers, 2 with breast cancer, 4 with rectal cancer, 4 with NPC, and 4 with other sites.Results : The Distance to Agreement (DTA) and the Dose Difference (ΔD) for The Gamma Agreement Index (GAI) of dosimetry parameters with EPID were set as 3 mm and less than 3% respectively. The average GAI (%) of patients in our study is 94.32 ± 3.19 (99.06-81.31). GAI (%) for prostate cancer, breast cancer, rectal cancer, NPC, and other sites is 93.62 ± 4.03 (99.06-81.31), 97.43 ± 1.14 (98.86-96.24), 92.96 ± 2.51 (97.19-89.01), 94.98 ± 2.31 (97.64-89.09), and 94.95 ± 2.48 (98.9-90.76), respectively. The GAI (%) for breast cancer had a better result, with a lowest value of 96.24. For one of the prostate cancer patient treated with 3 arcs, there are two arcs had a GAI value below 90%.Conclusions: It is an easy and feasible way to apply the EPID with Epiqa software as dosimetry verification tool for VMAT. We will gather more clinical data to come out a better dosimetry verification procedure for VMAT in the near future.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Owning to the extended waiting list and the possibility of treatment delay, the department of radiation oncology at a medical center referred its waiting outpatients to another regional hospital which was affiliated to the same health care system and equipped with similar linear accelerator facility, but located across the Taipei basin. The purpose of this study is to survey the opinion and demand of referred patients and their family member to this service mode, and to provide a reference for future quality improvement.Material and Method: Between December 2010 and January 2012, there were 65 patients referred to the regional teaching hospital for radiotherapy. A self-constructed structural questionnaire was designed according to the characteristic of outpatient at department of radiation oncology. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate the consideration and satisfaction with this referral mode.Results : When patient considering to accept trans-hospital referral or not, the most critical factor in decision making was fear of being delayed or the anxiety associated with waiting (56.9%), the second was the confidence in the same health care system (23%), and the third was the convenience in transportation and parking (20.1%). The service patients most satisfied with were the exclusively reserved daily treatment schedule (55.4%), and the free transportation shuttle to and fro the medical center and regional hospital. In general, most patients (89.2%) acknowledged this referral mode and the service quality of this regional hospital.Conclusion: Cancer is a serious disease, and both patients themselves and hospital hope to complete the treatment as soon as possible. In circumstances when medical resources can not meet the needs and referral are suggested, hospital must provide proper arrangement. In spite of transportation across district, referral within the same health care system has advantages in ensuring the execution and consistency of cancer treatment. The considerations and opinions to this referral mode can provide useful reference for medical business management and health policy making.',\n",
       " 'Gene sequencing may be a feasible means of individualizing cancer treatment. By investigating the correlation between genetic profiles and treatment outcomes of chemotherapy, it may be possible to determine effective treatment strategies according to individual genotypes in cancer patients. Despite great advances in drugs for cancer treatment, treatment outcomes may be improved by analyzing genetic markers that indicate treatment efficacy. We report the treatment for a patient with metastatic colon cancer in which gene sequencing was used for the selection of an effective chemotherapy regimen. In addition, we describe the entire course of treatment, including the combination of surgical resection for local control and radiotherapy to eradicate distant metastases. This is a pilot report of the clinical use of gene sequencing for determining a treatment regimen. Further clinical trials are needed to optimize the personalization of cancer treatment.',\n",
       " \"Objectives/Hypothesis: The association between weight loss during radiotherapy (RT) and patients' survival has not been assessed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study was aimed to investigate this association and also determine whether pretreatment body mass index (BMI) affects the association between weight loss and overall survival.Methods: 1583 NPC patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2007 undergoing definitive RT were consecutively enrolled. Survival analyses were performed with stratification according to weight change (≧5% vs.＜5%) and pretreatment BMI (≧25 vs.＜25) respectively. Cox proportional hazards model was carried out to evaluate the impact of weight change, pretreatment BMI on survival controlling for the other clinically relevant factors.Results: Weight change (≧5%) during RT is significantly influenced by age, chemotherapy, RT duration and pretreatment BMI. A statistically significant association between the status of weight change and overall survival could be identified both in univariate and multivariate analyses. After further stratification by BMI (≧25 or＜25), there is a significantly positive impact of weight loss≧5% on survival particularly among the patients who are overweight or obese (p=0.046, log-rank test).Conclusions: A weight loss≧5% during RT confers a more favorable overall survival in NPC patients who are initially overweight or obese (BMI≧25). The explanation for this phenomenon warrants further analyses with regard to locoregional control and underlying biological mechanisms.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) in detecting intracranial extension of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and to analyze the impact on treatment outcome.Materials and Methods: From December 1997 to December 2004, 587 patients with histologically confirmed NPC (Iess than or equal to stage IVA according to American Joint Committee on Cancer, sixth edition) and received therapeutic radiation dose who underwent CT and MRI for evaluation of primary tumor extension. AII o f the images were reviewed and assessed by two physicians independently. Cases with variable interpretation or disagreement between the observers, these images were reevaluated side by side and any discrepancy was resolved by consensus. The kappa test for inter-observer concordance was 0.841 for CT and 0.931 for MRI.Results: The detection rate of intracranial invasion by MRI was 62.7% and that by CT was 15.5% (p＜0.001). The group with no intracranial invasion detected by MRI or CT (group 1) had significantly higher overall survival rate than intracranial invasion detected by MRI but not by CT (group 2, p＜0.001) or intracranial invasion detected by both MRI and CT (group 3, p＜0.001). For group 2 patients, chemotherapy plus radiotherapy had higher overall survival rate than radiotherapy alone (p＜0.001). Group 2 and 3 had the odd ratio of 3.2 and 4.0 comparing to group 1 by Cox regression. According to different treatment modalities, patients treated by radiotherapy alone had odd ratio of 2.6 comparing to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy.Conclusion: MRI owned a higher intracranial invasion detection rate than CT. Patients with intracranial involvement should receive both chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to improve overall survival, even those with only subtle intracranial invasion.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To check the clinical normal tissue effects of quantitative analyses in the clinical (QUANTEC) guidelines by using quality of life (QoL) questionnaire dataset on the head and neck (HN) cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.Materials and Methods: Questionnaires of QoL for 95 patients with NPC and 142 with HNSCC were analysed, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer H&N35 QoL questionnaire was performed as the endpoint assessment. Compared with pre-treatment, the degree of QoL scoring of 66-100 points were defined as moderate to severe xerostomia. We used the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) to describe the incidence of xerostomia. Negative predictive value (NPV) was used to determine the prediction accuracy of the complications.Results: The fitting parameters of NTCP were set at two time points, for 3-months and 12-month with TD50=39.8 Gy, m=0.28 and TD50= 45.2 Gy, m=0.24, respectively. We found that the parotid gland with the mean doses of less than 20 and 25 Gy in the HN and HNSCC cohorts were verified with similar results at 3 months. Besides, the analysis of the QoL datasets at 3 months showed that about ~6% and ~16% rates of xerostomia, and those at 12 months showed that about ~5% and ~14%, respectively. For patients with NPC, the data showed that about the ~0% and ~33% opportunity respectively to produce xerostomia at 3 months (NPV of approximately 67%). However, both data showed that ~0% (NPV of approximately 100%) at 12 months. There are with significant difference from the results for the HNSCC cohort.Conclusion: The QoL datasets testified the practicality of QUANTEC guidelines. We proposed amendments to the parotid gland QUANTEC 20/20 Gy spared-gland guideline for HNSCC cohort. Moreover, the QUANTEC 25 Gy guideline was applicable to the clinical use of the NPC, which can effectively avoid xerostomia.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: The early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of tremendous importance to prevent this devastating and frequently reported cancer. Therefore, it is required to identify novel and specific HCC diagnostic marker(s) to distinguish HCC patients from non-HCC patients at the early stage of HCC development. We employed surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) to analyze protein profiles in the serum of Taiwanese HCC and healthy, non-HCC subjects.Materials and Methods: The SELDI-Chip-System was used to determine a specific protein pattern in serum samples obtained from Taiwanese HCC and non-HCC subjects. The initial training group consisted of 63 subjects from whom serum was collected at the Yuan's General Hospital (Taiwan). To validate a potential marker pattern, a second group of 63 Taiwanese subjects was enrolled from whom serum samples were also collected, randomized, and used in a blind validation study. Serum was applied to Ciphergen ProteinChip® SAX2 Arrays and proteins bound to the chips were analyzed using the ProteinChip Reader Model PBS II. After reading the chips, all profiles of normal and tumor serum were summarized using the Biomarker pattern software to a master pattern followed by analyses using a clustering method and data mining.Results: By recruiting two groups of 63 subjects for training and validation, we identified a biomarker pattern that contained four serum protein markers with m/z of 4091, 5637, 6840, and 8567. This study allowed setting up an artificial network with high specificity and sensitivity for HCC detection. In other words, the identified biomarker pattern was used to classify serum samples of HCC and non-HCC validation group subjects. During the latter experiment, it appeared that the sensitivity and specificity of the pattern was 93.33% and 93.93%, respectively. The specimens were used to analyze and develop a classification scoring system.Conclusions: For the first time, SELDI-TOF-MS combined with a simple scoring system were employed to identify a specific biomarker pattern that allowed to efficiently and significantly distinguish Taiwanese HCC patients from non-HCC patients.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To retrospectively review the results of patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) from an unknown primary site (UPS) treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in a single institute.Methods and Materials: Fourteen male patients with a median age of 48 (range 33 to 67) who presented with unknown primary SCCHN were treated with IMRT with or without cisplatin-based chemotherapy from 2005 to 2010. The number of patients with initial presentation of N1, N2a, N2b and N3 was, 1 (7%), 3 (21%), 6 (43%) and 4 (29%), respectively. Twelve patients (86%) received neck dissections and two had excision biopsies only. Five patients (36%) had metastatic nodes involving both upper and lower neck, where 9 (64%) had nodes limited to the upper neck only. Five (36%) patients presented with extracapsular spread (ECS). Patients undergoing neck dissection were treated with a median dose of 66 Gy to the ECS surgical bed. Those who did not undergo neck dissection were given 60 Gy. For those who had only excision biopsy, 70 Gy was prescribed to the tumor bed and suspected Iymphadenopathy. For all patients, a median dose of 59.4 Gy and 50 Gy was given to the pharyngeal mucosa and uninvolved lower neck, respectively. The irradiated pharyngeal mucosa, included the nasopharynx, oropharynx, surpaglottis and upper hypopharynx, but spared the vocal cords and lower hypopharynx.Results: After a median follow up of 36.4 months, four patients (21%) developed distant metastases and died, yielding a 3-year overall survival rate of 79%. There was no occurrence of the occult primary and no local regional recurrence noted. The control rate was 100%. Two patients had second primary tumors noted over the cervical esophagus and the buccal mucosa. In subgroup analysis, patients with clinical N3 stage, with nodal involvement over the lower neck region and nodes possessing ECS had significantly poorer overall survival and poor distant metastases-free survival rates. In patients with cN2 or cN3 disease, those receiving excision biopsy had a poor overall survival (p=0.001) and distant metastases-free survival (p=0.029) compared to those undergoing neck dissection. There was no grade III chronic toxicity during follow-up.Conclusions: In our experience, IMRT with vocal cords and lower hypopharyngeal sparing can achieve excellent functional outcomes without compromising disease control and may be adopted as a safe and effective treatment for SCCHN of UPS Patients with clinical N3 stage, lower neck involvement and nodes with ECS have significantly poorer overall survival and distant metastases-free survival rates. More intense regimens should be developed for such patients.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To determine the feasibility and efficacy of 60 Gy/3 fractions with Cyberknife image-guided robotic stereotactic radiosurgery for limited liver metastases.Materials and Method: Between 2009 to 2011, a total of 7 patients with inoperable, limited numbers of liver metastases underwent Cyberknife image-guided robotic stereotactic radiosurgery at our center. Follow-up time ranged from 5-25 months (median: 17 mo.). Four patients had a solitary lesion and 3 had small multiple lesions (Iess than 3 nodules), the maximum tumor diameter ranged from 1.5 cm. to 5 cm. Primary tumor sites were rectal cancer (n=2), lung Cancer (n=2), pancreatic cancer (n=1), renal cell cancer (n=1), bladder cancer (n=1). The ages ranged from 60-87 years old. The patients were treated with 60 Gy delivered in 3 fractions given every other day. Isodose value range from 75-80% of the prescribed dose.Results: A follow-up CT-scan of the abdomen done 3 months after Cyberknife image-guided robotic stereotactic radiosurgery showed complete response was attained in 3 patients and partial response in 4 patients. Six months after the treatment all patients achieved a complete tumor response. Only 1 patient shown grade 1 acute liver and gastrointestinal toxicity. No severe complication was attributed to the therapy. The l-and 2-year overall survival rate was 71.4% and 42.8%, respectively. Median survival was 17 months (6-26 months) [95% CI 6.75-27.26], and median progression-free survival was 9 months (5-26 months) [95% CI 1.3-16.7].Conclusion: Cyberknife image-guided robotic stereotactic radiosurgery in 60 Gy/3 fractions for limited liver metastases is feasible and effective. Excellent local control can be achieved with minimal toxicity. While our data established the safety of this treatment, more rigorous clinical studies are needed to fully evaluate long term efficacy and toxicity results.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: In recent years, the dose perturbation caused by the Henschke applicator is a major concern in brachytherapy planning system (BPS). To investigate impact of the dose where there is a lack of metal shielding, Monte Carlo simulations, and BPS calculations have been performed for dose assessments in a Plastic Water® phantom.Material and Methods : A Henschke applicator consists of one tandem and two ovoids. In this study, an 192 Ir source would be driven into all three channels of a Henschke applicator, at the middle of each ovoid, and at the center of two ovoids. For BPS, the origin of the coordinates was set at the middle of two ovoids, as was the Monte Carlo simulation. The dose normalization point was the average dose at six arbitrary points extended to the surface of the ovoids by 5 mm. Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code MCNP (X-5 Monte Carlo Team) was used in this study to simulate the dose distribution and output simulation data was recorded by mesh tally. The Monte Carlo set-up parameters had been validated by TG-43 data in a previous report.Results: The isodose distribution with Henschke applicator and without Henschke applicator showed tremendous deviation between Monte Carlo simulation and BPS calculation. This indicated that a Henschke applicator affected the isodose distribution significantly. Compared to the prescription dose area, the simulation isodose curves had a shrinkage of about 0.5 cm, when the metal applicator was considered.Conclusions: The Henschke applicator affected the dose distribution significantly and this could be observed in Monte Carlo simulation, but not in BPS.',\n",
       " 'Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (SFTP) is an uncommon neoplasm. Surgery is the only curative therapy and provides a definitive diagnosis. Among these patients, malignant SFTP was reported having high recurrent rate and poor prognosis. Because of the rare incidence, the role of radiotherapy (RT) in the management of the disease has not been well defined. We reported a 50-year-old woman with malignant SFTP in the right thorax, which has been living free of disease for more than 2 years after surgery with microscopic residual disease and adjuvant RT. Adjuvant RT could be an option of treatment for microscopically residual disease of malignant SFTP following major surgery.',\n",

We reported two cases with brainstem cavernoma treated with linear accelerator (LlNAC) cone-based stereotactic radiosurgery.CASE 1: A 44 year-old female patient survived from brainstem cavernoma with bleeding into right pons. She recovered her neurological function gradually in months. Another growing cavernoma at left pons was noted by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain. It was treated with cone-based stereotactic radiosurgery. The prescribed radiation dose was 14 Gy in two fractions. No new neurological deficit was noted after radiosurgery. On the regular follow-up of brain MRI, the cavernoma over left pons remitted gradually, and no cerebral edema related to radiosurgery was observed.CASE 2: A 43 year-old male patient with history of left orbital cavernoma status post operation and radiation therapy in 1997 had a 0.7 cm cavernoma at left ambient cistern of the 4th ventricle roof.

       " 'Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare irradiated lung volume/dose for breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy after modified radical mastectomy or breast conservative surgery.Materials & Method: Between July 2009 and October 2010, we collected 116 breast cancer patients who were referred to our department for adjuvant radiotherapy. Seventy-seven received breast conservative surgery and 39 received modified radical mastectomy. We used a treatment planning system to estimate the irradiated lung volume at different dose levels and to discover if different surgical methods or any other factors affected irradiated volume. For statistics, we used two sample t-test and one-way analysis of variance to perform the univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively.Results: The results from the univariate analysis showed that patients receiving breast conservative surgery, with earlier stage, or without suprac1avicular coverage had a significantly lower mean percentage of irradiated lung volume compared to patients receiving modified radical mastectomy, with advanced stage, or with supraclavicular coverage. Left side lesion was a borderline factor in predicting the higher mean percentages of lung volumes at higher dose levels. In the multivariate analysis; however, the stage was not a significant factor. On the other hand, lesion side and supraclavicular coverage were statistically significant factors for lung volumes, and surgical methods affected lung volumes at the higher doses.Conclusion: Patients with breast conservative surgery appear to have a lower irradiated lung volume/dose compared to patients with modified radical mastectomy when post-operative adjuvant radiation is indicated.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: In this study, we evaluated the clinical outcomes of glioblastoma multilorme (GBM) patients with their prognostic factors.Materials and Method: From March 2001 through October 2008, we evaluated 114 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed GBM in a single institution. Most patients received tumor resection followed by radiotherapy (RT) with or without temozolomide use, while some received tumor resection alone. Clinical characteristics, image findings, treatment modalities, and overall survival (OS) of these patients were reviewed and analyzed.Results: Thirty-live patients were treated with total or subtotal tumor resection followed by RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide, 55 treated with tumor resection and adjuvant RT, and 24 treated with resection alone. At a median follow-up time of 40.6 months (ranging from 0.3 to 61 .8 months), the median OS for all the patients was 12.5 months, and the one-year and two-year OS rates were 50% and 17.5%, respectively. Patients receiving combined tumor resection with RT and temozolomide had a better median OS than those without temozolomide used (19.4 vs. 10.1 months, p = 0.01). In univariate analysis, poor Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (≤ 70, P = 0.036), multiple neurologic deficits (p = 0.044), multiple brain lesions or corpus callosum invasion (p = 0.003) , subtotal resection (p = 0.001) , no RT (p ＜ 0.001) , and no temozolomide (p = 0.001) were significant prognostic factors for predicting poor OS of these patients. In multivariate analysis, multiple neurologic deficits (p = 0.008), multiple brain lesions or corpus callosum invasion (p = 0.007), subtotal resection (p = 0.005), no RT (p ＜ 0.001), and no temozolomide (p = 0.007) remained independent worse prognostic factors for OS 01 these patients.Conclusion: Our results indicated that multiple neurologic deficits, image findings of corpus callosum invasion or multiple brain lesions, and single modality treatment were important factors for predicting poor prognosis.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To compare stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for improving hepatocellullar carcimona (HCC) patient survival rates.Material and Method: Forty-one patients with unresectable or recurrent HCC were divided into one group of 20 patients who received SBRT, and another group of 21 patients who received 3D-CRT. They were treated in the Radiation Oncology Department of the Tri-Service General Hospital from March 2007 to March 2009. The median follow-up time for all patients was 12 months (range 2 to 36 months). Overall survival was the primary end point.Results: For the 3D-CRT and SBRT patient groups, the median survival (MS) was 11 months and 16 months with the 1-year overall survival (OS) of 42.9% and 70.0%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, CyberKnife SBRT (p= 0.019), non-advanced Okuda stage (p= 0.002), serum albumin higher than 3.5g /dl (p= 0.008), and total bilirubin lower than 2.0 mg/dL (p= 0.042) were associated with significantly better OS. Further statistical analyses showed that those patients in Child-Pugh class A who received SBRT had better OS than those who received 3D-CRT (p= 0.047). Multivariate analyses revealed that Okuda stage (p= 0.006). Child-Pugh class (p= 0.042) and technique of RT (p= 0.029) were significant prognostic factors for OS.Conclusions: This study showed that patients who received SBRT had significantly better OS than those who received 3D-CRT. SBRT has the advantage of short overall treatment times compared to 3D-CRT. Our results also suggest that SBRT could be considered first in patients with Child-Pugh class A. Further study is required to define the effects of administered radiation dose and fractionation.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the treatment of synchronous or metachronous hypopharyngeal / laryngeal / oropharyngeal head and neck cancer (H&N cancer) and esophageal cancer in our institution.Materials and Method: The retrospective study included patients with synchronous or metachronous H&N and esophageal cancer treated at our institution from 1998 to 2008. A synchronous malignancy was defined as a second malignancy diagnosed within 6 months after the initial diagnosis of cancer. A metachronous malignancy was defined as a second malignancy diagnosed more than 6 months after the initial diagnosis of cancer. For the treatment of esophageal cancer, 11 patients underwent surgery with or without neoadjuvant concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT), and the other 22 patients received definitive radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy. For the treatment of H&N cancer, 15 patients underwent surgical intervention with or without adjuvant CCRT, and the other 18 patients received definitive CCRT.Result: Our study included 33 patients. Among these patients, 10 presented with synchronous H&N and esophageal cancer, and 23 patients developed metachronous carcinomas. The median age at primary diagnosis was 56.8 years (range: 40.7-79.6 years). The median follow-up time for living patients was 41 .3 months. For the entire group, the median overall survival time (OS) and disease-free survival time (DFS) were 13.6 and 9.3 months, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that T stage of esophageal cancer (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4) was a significant prognostic factor for OS and DFS (22.5 vs.12.2 months [p=0.041], and 21.3 vs. 8.5 months [p = 0.020], respectively). In the case of synchronous or metachronous esophageal cancer, surgical intervention was associated with a better outcome than radiotherapy, with borderline significance (p = 0.076).Conclusions: Patients with synchronous or metachronous H&N and esophageal cancer had poor outcomes. Those with T1/T2 esophageal cancer had a better chance for survival than those with T3/T4 esophageal cancer. This result implies that the T stage of esophageal cancer is a prognosis-limiting factor. Routine screening for synchronous or metachronous esophageal cancer may facilitate early detection and thereby improve the outcomes.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: The goal of this study was to investigate the accuracy of VMAT with different calculation parameters in SmartArc. Dosimetric comparisons of various gantry spacings with and without couch (WC/WOC) insert simulation were evaluated based on statistics.Materials and Method: Twenty-eight VMAT cases were selected in this study, including 8 abdomen/pelvis, 6 one-side HN, 8 two-side HN and 6 prostate. A commercial Elekta Synergy linear accelerator and SmartArc algorithm in Pinnacle^3 9.0 was used. The patients were treated clinically with VMAT using 3° gantry spacing and reoptimized using 2°, 4° and 6°. An 8 mm thick water equivalent contour couch was added under the phantom. The phantom was irradiated with 0.125 cm^3 Semiflex chamber and Gafchromic EBT2 film simultaneously.Results: 99.1% and 94.6% of WC and WOC passed the 3% point dose difference criteria. In absolute dosimetric agreement of EBT2 film, the gamma passing rate of 3%/3 mm for all 224 plans separately were 5.4% for WC and 11.6% for WOC below 95% tolerance level. While using clinical parameters (3° gantry spacing, WC), the 3%/3 mm gamma average passing rate was 98.3±2.3%, 99.5±0.5%, 97.6±2.8% and 99.5±0.5% for abdomen/pelvis, one-side HN, two-side HN and prostate respectively Considered with the 2-6° gantry spacing, the Kruskal-Wallis H test shows very similar results and failures situations occurred randomly on any gantry spacing. The results 01 with /without couch insert simulation shows the Mann-Whitney U test p-value lower than or close to, the significant level expected for prostate cases. Spearman's correlation coefficient indicates that delivery MU may inlluence the accuracy (p-value ＜ 0.05) but it's independent of PTV volume.Conclusions: Composite dose measurements performed with EBT2 film are a practicable approach for patient-specific QA of VMAT plans. Film dosimetry in this study has shown good agreement in various parameter settings.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: To study how neck-shoulder bag (NSB) improve the setup accuracy among head and neck cancer patients during radiation therapy (RT) by analyzing the cervical spine curvature difference.Meterials and Method: Between March 2008 and March 2009, sixty-six consecutive head and neck cancer patients received RT with immobilization by thermoplastic mask and hollow-pillow. These 66 patients were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 37) were those with a neck to couch perpendicular distance (NCD) ＜ 3 cm, measuring at the point just caudal to the hollow-pillow, and the γ did not use the NSS for neck support Group S (n = 29) were those with NCD equal to or larger than 3 cm, and all of them used NSB during RT. Another cohort of 31 cases treated in the year 2007, not using the NSB was used as the retrospective control group. Among these 31 cases, fifteen have NCD ＜ 3 cm (Group A') and sixteen cases were 3 cm (Group B'). Patient's cervical spine curvature was quantified by his/her second and fifth cervical vertebrae intersecting angle (cervical spine angle, CSA). It was measured weekly from patient's portal images and simulation films. A small difference between the weekly CSA indicated good setup accuracy. Body weight change, surgery prior to RT, NCD, and whether using a NSB or not were investigated correlating to CSA. Analyses were performed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and SPSS17 for independent univariate t test.Results: A total of 582 portal images were obtained. Patients with NCD ＜ 3 cm and not using the NSB have a CSA weekly difference of 0.67±2.58° for Group A, and 1.03±3.48° for Group A' (p = 0.484). Those with NCD ≥3 cm, CSA weekly variation for Group B was 0.41±0.66°, and was 1.52±3.63° for Group B', (p = 0.046). Surgery prior to RT significantly increased the CSA range of difference (p = 0.0436). Body weight change had little to no correlation with CSA variation (r range: 0.01 to -0.21).Conclusions: Our results indicated using NSS in patients with NCD ≥3 cm significantly reduced CSA variation among RT fractionations, thus improved setup accuracy. Patients with NCD ＜ 3 cm had acceptable setup accuracy in the absence of NSB.\",\n",
       " 'Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare malignancy with aggressive behavior and dismal outcome; the optimal treatment has not yet been determined. Debulky surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has been reported to have better local control for locally advanced ATC. However, the technical limitations of conventional RT made it difficult to irradiate a homogenous and effective dose to the thyroid region. Recent advances in RT techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) provided the potential to conquer the limitation. Additionally, IMRT using simultaneous integrated boost technique (SIB-IMRT) further improved the biologic and dosimetric advantages.

       " 'Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of complete tumor response (CR) achieved following two different neoadjuvant modalities and the importance of major surgery after neoadjuvant treatment. Materials and Method: Between March 1999 and December 2007, this is retrospective study included 417 patients with newly-diagnosed dissemination-naive rectal cancer, treated with pre-operative short-course radiotherapy (RT) or long-course chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). The status of tumor response was confirmed by biopsy or surgery. Result: Median follow-up was 30.9 months. After neoadjuvant treatment, CR was documented in 5 of 221 patients (2%) in the short-course RT group, and 34 of 198 (17%) in the long-course CCRT group (p ＜ 0.001). The 5-year overall survival rate was 59% in short-course RT group and 49% in long-course CCRT group respectively. Focusing on the subgroup that was documented to achieve pathological tumor complete response (pCR), the survival benefit was most clear in those who received major surgery after neoadjuvant treatment rather than local excision only. There were more patients receiving merely local excision or observation in CCRT group (n= 50, 25.5%) than in RT alone group (n= 7, 3%). In the subgroup analysis specific to the patients who underwent standard major surgery after neoadjuvant treatment, no statistically significant difference in terms of overall survival was found between these two different neoadjuvant settings (p= 0.657). Conclusions: Subgroup analysis pertaining to patients who actually received major surgery after neoadjuvant treatment showed that there was no significant difference with regard to overall survival rates in these two neoadjuvant settings. The importance of patient compliance and performing major surgery after neoadjuvant treatment was clearly demonstrated in this retrospective study.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The aims of this study are assessing the nutritional status and quality of life (QoL) in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated by radiotherapy, and discussing the impacts of radiotherapy and nutritional status on QoL. Materails and Methods: From August 2007 to April 2009, one hundred and fifty hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated by radiotherapy at a teaching hospital in central Taiwan were enrolled in this study. Nutritional status and QoL of the patients were assessed by means of the Mini-Nutrition Assessment (MNA) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core-3D (EORTC QLQ-C30) at three different time points: before treatment, end of treatment, and 1 month after treatment.  Results: Forty-two percent patients had the problem of nutritional status before radiotherapy. There was no significant changes in nutritional status of the patient s who received radiotheray (Friedman X^2 = 2.06, p = 0.358). The nutritional status correlated with global health status, all five functioning scales and the most of symptom scales /item at all of the different time points. Using generalized estimating equation, global health status (p ＜ 0.01), global functioning status (p ＜ 0.05), the most severe symptoms included fatigue (p ＜ 0.05), financial difficulty (p ＜ 0.001 ), and pain ( p ＜ 0.01) were significantly improved after radiotherapy. The nutritional status o f the patients were strong relationship with global health status (p ＜ 0.001), global functioning status (p ＜ 0.001), insomnia (p ＜ 0.01), fatigue (p ＜ 0.001), financial difficulty (p ＜ 0.001), loss of appetite (p ＜ 0.001) and pain (p ＜ 0.01). Conclusion: Although the level o f nutritional status of the patients is not effectively increase in a short period, it would be worth to note that the QoL and the most of the major symptoms are significantly improved after the patient s received radiotherapy. Considering, the nutritional status of the patients will directly influence their QoL and the major symptoms. The patients with hepatocellular carcinoma should have to establish nutritional assessment and arrange early nutritional intervention before radiotherapy to get more nutritional support, and in turn to improve the QoL.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Glioblastoma multilorme (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults, Here we presented our institution experience of treatment resu1ts in Taiwan GBM patients and analyzed the prognostic factors. Materials and Methods: From Apri1 1998 to August 2010, 30 patients with GBM received tumor excision and radiotherapy with/without chemotherapy in our institution. Sixteen patients were ma1e (53%), and 14 were female (47%). The median age was 61 years. The performances status of Karnofsky Performance Sca1e was ≥70 in 19 patients (63%), and ＜70 in 11 patients (37%). The median size of tumor was 5.0 cm. All patients had definitive or post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy with/without chemotherapy. The median total radiation dose was 5940 cGy. Thirteen patients (43%) received chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens included ACNU, BCNU and Temozolomide. The follow-up period ranged from 1.2 to 49.3 months (median, 10.4 months) Results: Eight patients (27%) had tumor response after treatments, 19 patients (63%) had progression of disease, and 3 patients (10%) had stable disease. The median survival duration was 10.4 months. Five patients (17%) were alive and 25 patients (83%) were dead at the 1ast 101l0w-up. The 1-year overall surviva1 was 49%, and the 2-year overall survival was 17%. Performance status was a statistically significant factor for overall surviva1 (p= 0.008, log-rank test; p= 0.025, Cox proportiona1 hazards model). Conclusion: Despite recent therapeutic advances, the prognosis of GBM remains poor. Poor response to current therapies and loco-regional recurrence still were the main failure patterns for GBM. A large series of more patients with longer follow-up and more effective treatments is warranted.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To investigate the outcome of intraluminal brachytherapy (ILBT) using Iridium 192 (Ir-192) for hepatobiliary cancers with biliary tract obstruction. Materials and Methods: The clinical data of eleven patients with hepatobiliary malignancies (clinical stage as Tl-4, NO-1, MO) were collected from March 2007 to March 2011. AII of them had biliary obstruction caused by hepatobiliary cancers. The age at the initial diagnosis ranged from 46 to 79 years with a median of 68 years. AII patients received three to five fractions of high dose-rate Ir-192 ILBT (twice a day, for two to three days) with mean dose 01 14 Gy (9-17.5 Gy, 3.13 Gy/fraction, b.i.d.) and 6 of them also received external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with mean dose of 44 Gy (40-64.8 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction/day). The median follow-up time from initial diagnosis was 10 months (1-28 months). Results: The mean value of pre-RT total bilirubin was 9.66 mg/dL (1.05-29.22 mg/dL) and that of post-RT was 1.73 mg/dL (0.27-4.23 mg/dL). The median survival time was 19 months for three patients with extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 9 months for three patients with intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 22 months for two patients with ampulla of Vater cancer and 5 months for those with hepatocellular carcinoma. The only single patient with gall bladder cancer survived 15 months.

       " 'Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare dosimetric parameters of TomoTherapy (Tomo) and 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) for craniospinal irradiation (CSI). Materials & Methods: Three patients requiring CSI treatments were enrolled. All patients were adult males and treated in the supine position. Computed tomography (CT) scans with 10mm slice thickness were acquired for both the 3D CRT and Tomo plans. The prescribed dosage of the planning target volume (PTV) was 32 Gy. Dose homogeneity index (DHI), conformal index (CI), and physical parameters were used to compare the differences between the two treatment modalities. Results: The V95% (volume of receiving at least 95% of prescribed dose) of planning target volume-brain (PTV-B) was 100% for six plans. The mean V95% of planning target volume-spine (PTV-S) were 98.7% and 100% for 3D CRT and Tomo plans, respectively. The mean Dmax (maximal dose) of PTV-B was higher on 3D CRT than on Tomo (37.4 Gy/117% vs. 33.6 Gy/105%). The mean Dmax of PTV-S on 3D CRT was much higher than that on Tomo (50.8 Gy/159% vs. 33 Gy/103%). The mean DHI of PTV-B showed significant differences between CRT (1.17) and Tomo (1 .05), p= 0.009. The dose distribution of PTV-S planned by Tomo was more homogenous than that planned by 3D CRT (mean DHI 1.03 vs. 1.59, p= 0.0047). There were no significant differences in the mean CI of PTV-B on CRT (0.76) and Tomo (0.74), p＞ 0.05. The mean CI of PTV-S of Tomo was better than that of 3D CRT (0.47 vs. 0.2, p＜ 0.05). There were decreases in all Dmax of organs at risk (OARs) in the Tomo group except for bilateral kidneys (Tomo vs. 3D CRT: 14.8 Gy vs. 3.8 Gy). Conclusion: Tomo is simpler than linear accelerator for CSI because there is no junction between treatment fields. The dosimetric parameters of DHI and CI are superior in the Tomo group. Decreased OAR dose via Tomo may be helpful for minimizing the long-term latent effect.',\n",

       " \"Purpose: To study the sensitizing effect of berberine on radiation-induced cytotoxicity in human liver cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, was used in combination with radiotherapy to treat a human liver cancer cell line, Hep3B. The cells were irradiated with the indicated single dose of 10Gy with or without berberine (10μM) and cell viability was analyzed on MTT(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl- tetrazolium bromide) assay. DAPI(4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)staining was used to detect the apoptosis and acridine orange was used to detect presence of acidic organelles formation. The morphology of the cells was observed under fluorescence microscope and apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins such as cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, p-JNK, Bcl-2 and Akt were analyzed on Western blot. Results: Radiation induced apoptotic cell death of Hep3B cells in a dose-dependent manner. The ratio of apoptotic cells increased from 15.3% in Hep3B treated with irradiation alone to 47.2% in Hep3B cells treated with irradiation in combination with berberine. Western blot analysis demonstrated increased expressions of apoptosis-related proteins, such as cytochrome c, Bax, p-JNK, and cleaved caspase-3, and decreased expressions of phosphorylated Akt and Bcl-2. Conclusion: Berberine enhances radiation-induced cytotoxicity in Hep3B cells most likely by activation of JNK and suppression of Akt.\",\n",

Ninety-three patients with squamous cell carcinoma (87.7%). Survival estimations were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results: The median age at diagnosis was 55 years (range: 34-86 years). The median follow-up period was 57.05 months (range: 4.57-137.3 months) respectively. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 63.4%, and 5-year local control (LC) and distant control (DC) rates of 61.3% and 57.0%, respectively. Thirty-four of 93 patients (36.6%) were diagnosed with recurrence or distant metastasis at the follow-up time. Twenty-five patients (26.8%) had distant failure, of which 24 had only distant metastasis, one patient had both distant and loco-regional recurrence, and the remaining 9 patients recurred locoregionally.ECOG performance status, tumor size, pelvic lymphadenopathy, pre-treatment hemoglobin and elevated serum SCC level after CCRT were significantly correlated with 5-year OS, LC and DC by univariate analysis. The ECOG performance status and elevated serum SCC after CCRT are significant prognostic factors for 5-year OS and LC rate. The performance status, tumor size (＞4 cm) and elevated serum SCC level after CCRT were significant for 5-year DC rate by multivariate analysis.Conclusions: The patient with poor ECOG performance status, bulky tumor (＞4cm) and elevated serum SCC after CCRT had worse outcome.

Through structured questionnaire method, the patients aged above 20 regardless of gender and education degree have filled the questionnaires. A total of 550 questionnaires were collected. Based on Pearson correlation analysis, the correlation statistic was conducted.Results: Most of the cancer patients were satisfied with the soft and hard facilities provided by hospital; Cancer patients were also satisfied with the medical workers' professional knowledge and technical proficiency. Further, 346 patients were satisfied with the hospital's efficiency of handling complaints and 384 patients felt it is worth while to pay the medical fees. As a result, 535 (97.3%) of the patients have expressed willingness to go back to the same hospital; 539 patients (98%) have shown willingness to recommend the hospital to their families and friends. 411 patients (74.7%) indicated that they will not choose other hospital even if the registration fee is lower.Discussion: The medical workers' professional knowledge and technical proficiency are correlated with the cancer patients' medical service satisfaction (p＜0.01) and are also correlated with the medical service procedure and the efficiency of handling patients' complaints (p＜0.01). The higher patients' medical service satisfaction is associated with higher rate of returning to the hospital. They are positively correlated (p＜0.003). The overall service from the hospital is positively correlated with the patients' willingness for recommendation. The patients will be more willing to recommend their families and friends to the hospital if they receive higher satisfaction with the hospital's overall medical service. The result is very significant (p＜0.003). When the cancer patients are satisfied with the overall service of the hospital they initially consulted, they will not choose other hospital even if the registration fee is lower.

       " 'Purpose: For the postoperative female pelvis intensity-modulated radiotherapy, contouring target volumes and normal structures around the paravaginal area varies greatly due to lack of landmarks of vaginal lumen. To aid a precise delineation for vaginal lumen, we developed a novel vagina enhancement modality (VEM) and evaluated its feasibility as well as dosimetric impact.Materials and Methods: Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan simulations with and without VEM were taken for 5 patients with cervical or endometrial carcinoma. For the plans with VEM, cervical clip markers and a jelly-based vaginal contrast were applied before CT-simulations. The clinical target volume (CTV) of paravaginal area below the parametrium was then delineated with a 0.5-cm margin around the visible vaginal lumen. As for the plans without VEM, we applied cervical clip markers only, and the paravaginal CTV was delineated as the interspace between bladder and rectum. The feasibility of VEM was evaluated based on the visualization rate. The difference of vaginal volume contoured was also analyzed. Dosimetric parameters including mean dose and dose-volume histograms were compared between plans with and without VEM.Result: We found that the vaginal lumen was successfully illustrated on CT-simulations with VEM. In RT plans with VEM, dosimetric analysis showed significant decrease in vagina volume, bladder V45, corresponding bladder V45 and V50. The mean dose of vagina and corresponding bladder, which are critically influenced by paravaginal contouring, also showed significant reduction with VEM.Conclusion: The novel vaginal enhancement modality is an effective guide to clearly define the vagina lumen in postoperative female pelvis IMRT with dosimetric improvements particularly in bladder and vagina.[Therapeut Radiol Oncol 2011; 18(4): 311-319]',\n",

In addition to reduce tongue and groove effect and to raise the spatial resolution of high dose area, collimator angle has become a determining factor for RapidArc optimization. This study try to find the most suitable collimator angle for RapidArc treatment planning system for patients with prostate cancer.Materials and Methods: Fifteen prostate cancer patients were selected to re-optimize the treatment plan of RapidArc. Five different collimator angles (15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°) were used while we doing the plans. RapidArc treatment plan optimization, using the same optimization parameters, such as dose constraint and priority for planned target volume and critical organ. The plan of 45 degree of collimator angle was used as the basis of comparison of the maximum dose(Dmax), homogeneity index(HI)and conformal index(CI)in the tumor and the dose received by critical organs.Result: To use the plan of 45 degree of collimator angle as the standard. When collimator rotated 15, 30, 60 and 75 degrees, there were 20% (3/15), 73.3% (11/15), 53.3% (8/15) and 20% (3/15) ratio of the Dmax lower than the Dmax calculated by 45 degree respectively. When collimator rotated 15, 30, 60 and 75 degrees, there were 6.7% (1/15), 46.7% (7/15), 40% (6/15) and 13.3% (2/15) ratio of results got more homogeneous distribution than 45 degree.

HT reduced V20 by more than 50% for each lung and reduced the mean lung dose by 22.2% and 33.8% in the right lung and left lung when compared with the IMRT technique, respectively.For palliative treatment, HT provides impressive ability for irregularly shaped metastatic sites and reduces painful sensation successfully.[Therapeut Radiol Oncol 2011; 18(4): 341-345]',\n",
       " \"Aims and Background: To review if hyperfractionated radiotherapy provides better tumor control over standard radiotherapy for malignant glioma without chemotherapy.Methods: The records of 48 patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma treated with hyperfractionated/standard radiotherapy were reviewed for survival and prognostic factors analyses. The radiation schedule consisted of standard fractionation (1.8~2 Gy/day) or hyperfractionated fractionation (1.2~1.5 Gy twice/day with at least 6 hours interval), depending on the preference of different physicians. None of them received chemotherapy. Eight patients underwent biopsy only, and 28 patients underwent subtotal resection. The rest 12 patients had gross tumor resection. Survival rates were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. In univariate analyses of survival time, the different variables were compared using the log rank test. Within the framework of Cox regression models, multivariate analysis was performed to differentiate the relationships between variables and their relevance to the survival.Results: No patient was lost to follow-up. Median survival was 13 months (range, 1-158 months). Two patients had complete response after radiotherapy. Twenty-two had partial response. The other 24 had stable disease or progression. The hyperfractionated radiotherapy group didn't show any benefit on survival (13 vs. 16.733 months, p=0.439). Age older than 50 years showed worse prognosis in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Tumor involvement more than one lobe, grossly total resection not achieved, and biologically equivalent dose (assuming α/β ratio=10) (BED10) less than 72 GyE had trends associating with worse prognosis, which were not statistically significant.Conclusion: In our study, patients didn't benefit from hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Due to small patient number, further investigation is warranted to evaluate the benefit and toxicity of hyperfractionated radiotherapy.\",\n",
       " 'Methods: Between 2003 and 2007, we retrospectively included 44 histologically proven oropharynx-hypopharynx carcinoma patients who were aged more than 70 years and treated non-surgically. Two groups were defined: the group A (induction chemotherapy plus CCRT, n=22) and the group B (RT alone, n=22). Patients in the group B were 1:1 match-paired to those in the group A by using three factors: cancer subsite, gender, and clinical stage. Totally, there were 36 males and 8 females, with a median age of 76 years (range, 70-88 years). Patient survival and cancer control were defined as study end points.Background: This study intended to compare treatment results between induction chemotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and radiotherapy (RT) alone in elderly oropharynx-hypopharynx carcinoma patients who were treated curatively and non-surgically.Results: The median follow-up time for all patients was 35.0 months (range, 1-72 months). At 3 years, the group A demonstrated better cancer controls than the group B, in terms of locoregional control (86.4% versus 36.4%, p=0.002) and disease-free survival (61.4% versus 36.4%, p=0.035). However, no statistically significant differences were found on disease-specific and overall survivals. Not surprisingly, more treatment-related toxicity were observed in the group A than in the group B (grade 3-4 mucositis, 63.6% versus 27.3%, p=0.015).Conclusions: For elderly oropharynx-hypopharynx carcinoma patients treated nonsurgically, induction chemotherapy plus CCRT significantly improves cancer control when compared with RT alone. RT alone should be reserved for patients who are medically contra-indicated to chemotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To investigate the impact of tumor volume in patients with the base of tongue (BOT) cancer treated with definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique (IMRT).Materials and Methods: From 2003 to 2009, 35 patients with stage Ⅱ-Ⅳ squamous cell carcinoma of the BOT cancer receiving organ preservation scheme were enrolled in this retrospective analysis. Radiotherapy was performed using a sequential IMRT. All patients received 1.8 Gy daily up to a median total dose 01 70.2 Gy to gross tumors and metastatic Iymph nodes, whereas the area harboring microscopic disease was prescribed with a median dose of 50.4 Gy. Twenty-four patients had concurrent chemotherapy. The regimen consisted of cisplatin (80-100 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 22, 43). Primary tumor volume measurement was derived using separate simulation images for the pretreatment gross tumor volume (pGTV) and the interval gross tumor volume (iGTV).Results: With a median follow-up duration of 18 months, 24 patients (68.5%) were found to have locoregional failures. The 2-year cause-specific survival was for all patients was 24%. The curve could be split into 25% for stage Ⅱ-Ⅲ disease, and 18% for stage Ⅳ disease (p=0.29). The 2-year primary relapse-free survival (PRFS) was 35% for patients with T2-T3 disease, and the curve dropped to zero for patients with T4 disease (p=0.01). The pGTV value ranged from 8.1 to 165 mL (median, 34.6 mL), whereas the iGTV ranged from 3.8 to 79.3 mL (median, 19.4 mL). Multivariate analysis showed that there were two predictors for the PRFS: pGTV≧20ml (p=0.02, hazard ratio=5.87, 95% CI 1.29-26.72) and volume reduction rate (VRR)＜0.4 (p=0.002, hazard ratio 4.33, 95% CI l.71~10.99).Conclusions: This preliminary study shows that IMRT outcome in the BOT cancer patients was unsatisfactory. To optimize the treatment result, an aggressive treatment scheme should be considered for large pretreatment tumor burden or a VRR less than 0.4.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To analyze the treatment outcome of patients with limited-stage small cell carcinoma (SmCC) of esophagus.Methods: Patients with limited-stage SmCC of esophagus presenting to Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1985 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical data were presented and analyzed. We calculated overall survival with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared the survival between different groups with the log-rank test.Results: SmCC of esophagus represented 0.89% of esophageal malignancies in this institution. Eleven (one female and ten male) patients with limited-stage SmCC of esophagus were included in this study. The median age was 70 years (range, 41-82 years). Eight of 11 patients had the main primary neoplasm over the middle third thoracic esophagus. With a median follow-up of 11 months (range, 2-144 months), only one patient remained alive without disease and the other ten patients died of the disease or treatment complication. The median overall survival was 11 months, with survival rates at 1, 2 and 5 years were 36%, 18% and 9%, respectively. At the last follow-up visit or mortality, lour patients had loco-regional failure only and live patients had loco-regional and distant relapse. We observed significantly longer median survival in patients 70 years old or younger (16 months vs. 5 months in patients older than 70 years old, P=0.036), patients receiving chemotherapy (16 months vs. 5 months in patients not receiving chemotherapy, P=0.001), and patients receiving local treatment (radiotherapy or surgery) plus chemotherapy (21 months vs. 6 months in patients not receiving local treatment plus chemotherapy, P=0.003).Conclusions: SmCC of esophagus was an aggressive neoplasm with poor prognosis. We recommend local therapy plus chemotherapy for patients with limited stage SmCC of esophagus.',\n",
       " 'Even though pancreatic cancer accounts for only 2% of all cancer diagnoses in Taiwan, it is one of the ten leading causes of cancer death and the most difficult malignancy to manage. Because of the usually late onset symptoms, hall of the patients presented with metastatic disease. Only 10-15% of patients had resectable disease at initial diagnosis. Around 30% of patients present with locally advanced disease that precludes resection. The use of chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is based on few randomized trials. Recent meta-analysis revealed a survival benefit for chemoradiotherapy over radiotherapy alone; however, chemoradiotherapy did not demonstrate significant survival advantage over chemotherapy alone. Because of similar outcome and lower toxicity, gemcitabine based chemotherapy is considered as a standard of care in many clinical situations. However, there is much controversy about the role of radiotherapy in local disease control. This paper reviews the current management options, controversies, and ongoing and future directions for the treatment of LAPC, focusing on the role of radiotherapy. The rationale and results of our phaseⅡ study on LAPC using induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation (TCOG1204) will be presented.',\n",
       " 'Radioresponse is influenced by factors extrinsic to cancer cells. Endothelial cells and infiltrating immune cells within the tumour microenvironment are the two components that significantly affect the outcome of radiotherapy. The benefits of fractionated radiotherapy are reduced by up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-lα (HIF-lα) and vasculoendothelial growth factor (VEGF). Further, the therapeutic effect of anti-angiogenic agents is counteracted by the mobilization of endogenous proangiogenic cells into the tumour microenvironment. In addition to endothelial cells, immune cells play an important role in the microenvironment that regulates tumour growth and response to therapy. In this review, we highlight some of the recent studies on the importance of immune cells in the microenvironment. The progress in developing combinations of radiotherapy and immunotherapy or other methods for modulation of the tumour immune microenvironment may yield fruitful results in the near future.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To compare the planning performance between dose-volume-based IMRT plans (DV-based IMRT plan, (DV-plan) ) and DV-plan with generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) optimization (DV-gEUD-based IMRT plan, (DV-gEUD-plan) ) on bilateral breast cancer (BBC).Materials and Methods: Six consecutive BBC patients (staged: T2-T4) were planed using the planning system of the Pinnacle^3 (version 8.0 m, Philips, Fitchburg, WI) to compare the performance of DV-and DV-gEUD plans. The plan was delivered on a Varian 21 EX Linac (Varian Medical Systems, Milpitas, CA) equipped with a 120-leaf multileaf collimator. The prescribed doses were 50.4 Gy/28 fractions to the planned target volume (PTV). The dosimetric parameters used included the conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI) and tumor control probability (TCP) for the PTV; and V(subscript 20Gy) and V(subscript 30Gy) for the total lung and heart, respectively; and mean dose, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the both OARs. The planning delivery accuracy was checked.Results: Both techniques fulfilled the objectives on target coverage. A comparable CI and HI of the PTV were observed on both plans. For the OARs, a significantly superior normal tissue sparing was observed in DV-gEUD-plan. The DV-gEUD-plan has smaller mean dose of lung and heart, V(subscript 20Gy) of lung, and V(subscript 30Gy) of heart (p＜0.05) with respect to the DV-plan. Both plans presented a high QA pass rate (＞95.5%) of the T(subscript 3mm. 3%) criterion.Conclusions: A better plan (DV-gEUD-plan) can be obtained through a combination of DV-and gEUD-based objective function, This hybrid approach can reduce the number of trial and error in DV-plan processing while retaining a better dose distribution which gEUD-plan can provide.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To improve dose homogeneity in total body irradiation (TBI) with lateral technique. Dose homogeneity and dosimetry of lung shielding are investigated.Materials and Methods: Five patients, three with acute Iymphocytic leukemia (ALL), one with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), and one with non-Hodgkin's Iymphoma (NHL), were delivered total body irradiation with lateral technique. An acrylic box was designed for treatment table, and water bags were utilized as tissue compensators to fill the surrounding space, conforming patients' body contours as possible. LiF thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were positioned along the reference points on the body surface. Treatment dose 1200 cGy, using 15 MV photons with dose rate 5 cGy/minute, divided in 8 fractions within 4 days was prescribed at the midline of the body, while partial lung block was designed to deliver 900 to 960 cGy to the midline of thorax in sum after lung correction calculation. The mean doses of different reference points throughout the body were obtained after calculation of three to four measurements for each patient to investigate dose homogeneity.Results: After application of tissue compensators with water bags thoroughly surrounding the patients, the average dose homogeneity was measured withinacceptable difference from the prescribed dose. Postural stability and reproducibility were satisfied. Treatment duration took about 50 minutes and patients tolerated the procedures well.Conclusion: Though anterioposterior TBI technique is commonly used with regard to better dose uniformity and setup procedures, there is superiority of consistency of lung shielding and patients' comfort to utilize lateral technique for fragile patients, especially when low dose rate is used and treatment duration prolongs. The application of tissue compensators with water bags as an alternative can be easily setup with acceptable dose homogeneity and treatment time.\",\n",

A definitive diagnosis can be made through histolopathologic examination and immunohistochemical profile. The main treatment modality is surgical excision. It is considered a radiosensitive tumor, however, the role of radiotherapy is uncertain. This is a report on a case of CASTLE of the neck treated with surgery but without adequate margin. A residual tumor was suspected on computed tomogram scan during follow-up, so sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy were given.

       " \"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the overall survival rate of patients with bone metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and prognostic factors affecting their outcomes.Materials and Methods: From June 1999 to January 2005, there were 69 patients with bone metastasis from HCC who were treated at our hospital. The variables, such as gender, age of diagnosis of bone metastasis, Pugh's modification of Child's grading of cirrhosis Okuda staging system, performance status, serum level of α-fetoprotein at diagnosis of bone metastasis from HCC, methods of treatment for bone metastasis, site of bone metastasis and metastasis to organ other than bones were analyzed about their influence upon prognosis.Results: Fifty-two patients (75.4%) are male and 17 patients (24.6%) are female. The medium age of diagnosis of bone metastasis was 66 years old (range from 31 to 78 years old). The medium survival from diagnosis of bone metastasis was 3.06 months. The 6-month, 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were 30.43%, 11.59% and 5.80%, respectively. In univariate analysis, Child's grading of cirrhosis (p=0.0022), Okuda staging system (p=0.0002), and performance status (p=0.0277) were statistically significant factors for survival. In multivariate analysis, performance status (p=0.003) was the only significant prognostic factor.Conclusion: The survival of patients with bone metastasis from HCC was poor. To improve the outcome, we should enroll more patients and arrange prospective trial by combination of locoregional and systemic therapy.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for unresectable or post-operative residual biliary tract carcinoma (BTC).Materials and Methods: From September 1997 to August 2005, twenty-eight patients with localized unresectable (23 patients) or post-operative residual (5 patients) BTC were treated by 3D-CRT. The median radiation dose was 62.0 Gy (21.6-70.0 Gy/1.8-2.5 Gy). Seven patients also underwent chemotherapy. The median follow-up time for all patients was 6.4 months.Results: The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.8 months and the 2-year actuarial PFS rate was 10.7%. The median overall survival (OS) was 8.4 months and the 2-year actuarial OS rate was 23.1%. In univariate analysis, both OS and PFS strongly correlate with the performance status, jaundice, radiation dose and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level. The PFS also significantly associates with unresectable tumor status. After multivariate analysis: good performance status (ECOG: 0 or 1) and higher radiation dose (＞50.0 Gy) were two independent prognostic factors which showed for patients with both PFS (p＜0.001 and p=0.046, respectively) and OS (p＜0.001 and p=0.010, respectively). The overall incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients without any previous peptic ulcer history was 18.2% and the complications were medically manageable.Conclusions: The study demonstrated that performance status and RT dose are two predictors for outcome in patients treated with 3D-CRT for unresectable or postoperative residual BTC.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with primary and metastatic lung tumors treated by CyberKnife(superscript ®) (CK) stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).Methods: Between November 2005 and June 2008, we treated 19 patients with SBRT at Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital. The SBRT was delivered by CK tumor tracking system. Tumor response and treatment-related toxicity were evaluated by follow-up image study. Treatment-related toxicities were scored by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. In this study, we reviewed their medical records retrospectively.Results: We treated 47 lung tumors in 19 patients using CK SBRT. Eleven tumors in 8 patients were primary lung cancer, and 36 tumors in 11 patients were metastatic lung cancer. The locations of 9 tumors were central, whereas the others were peripheral. The tumor volumes were ranged from 1.1 to 110.5 ml (median, 9.5 ml). The radiation doses were ranged from 22 to 60 Gy, given in 2 to 4 fractions. The prescribed doses were normalized at 76% to 85% of the planned isodose. With a median follow-up interval of 12 months, we observed that grade 2 radiation pneumonitis (RP) occurred in 3 patients (1 central; 2 peripheral), whereas we found that grade 3 RP occurred in 2 patients with central lesions. According to the univariate analysis, female (p=0.038) and central lesion (p=0.042) were two predictive factors to the occurrence of grade≥2 RP. One grade 4 tracheal complication (tracheoesophageal fistula) and one grade 5 bronchial complication (bronchial necrosis) were observed in two patients who had centrally located recurrent tumors and had been previous treated with external beam radiotherapy. Four of the evaluable patients (16 patients) had responded completely (25%), seven exhibited partial response to treatment (43.8%), and two had stable disease (12.5%). Three patients had tumor progression after SBRT (18.7%). The 1-year overall survival (OS) was 63%, and the 1-year local progression-free survival (PFS) was 84.2%. The 1-year local PFS was 87.5% for primary lung cancer and 81.8% for metastatic lung cancer (p=0.87). The 1-year local PFS for central and peripheral lesions was 80% and 85.7%, respectively (p=0.63).Conclusion: Our study showed that SBRT using the CK system was effective for treating primary and metastatic lung tumors, providing better local control and shorter treatment course compared with those treated with conventional fractionated radiotherapy. Our study also showed two predicting factors for RP. Finally, using SBRT to treat centrally located tumor or re-irradiate recurrent tumor require additional caution due to higher risk of having complication. Thus, we suggest that more studies are needed in the future to confirm those findings in this study.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Obturator neuropathy is a late complication of radiotherapy (RT) and chemo-radiation in cervical cancer patients. We studied the feasibility of sparing the obturator nerves in patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by delineating the obturator nerves in obturator canals near to the high dose region in pelvis irradiation.Materials and Methods: Volumetric computed tomography (CT) images of ten patients with cervical cancers were retrieved. Anatomical orientation of obturator canals were gathered based on published knowledge in textbooks. Target volume of obturator nerves and pertinent normal structures were contoured and reconstructed for IMRT planning. Dosimetric parameters including dose-volume histograms (DVHs), maximal dose, prescription dose coverage and conformal index were compared between plans with and without obturator nerves as organ of avoidance.Result: A guideline for delineation of obturator canals for IMRT on axial contrast CT images was derived. The use of sparing the obturator nerve technique resulted in an average of 18.3±4.1 % decrease in the calculated maximum dose of the obturator nerves (p＜0.05). No significant impact on the conformality and coverage of planning target volume (PTV) of cervical cancer and neither significant dosimetric impact on other critical normal organs in pelvic area.Conclusion: We found that sparing the obturator nerve technique is feasible for patients with cervical cancer and treated with IMRT. The reduction of doses to OBN did not compromise target coverage of tumor and DVHs of other normal organs.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: Normally, the conventional acrylic board with parallel holes template in prostate needle implant lead disadvantages to be able to tile or rotate when needles need to approach seminal vesicle or to avoid the obstruction of symphysis pubis. In order to overcome the disadvantages of conventional templates, we developed a special template for guiding needles insertion and fixation when practice prostate needle implant.Materials and Methods: Two acrylic board, each with 7.5 cm by 7.5 cm of width, length and 0.5 cm thickness, were drilled a set of domed holes and cones combination placed split balls inside this combination to provide firmly grip and fixation of needles both in tilting and rotation movement. Thirety nine domed-cones combination concentric circles array provide at most thirety nine needles insertion and eight nylon screws screwed tight to compress those thirety nine glass fiber reinforced plastic split balls inside domed-cones combination to support needles fixation. All these materials have been considered the tolerance not to be spoiled under normal sterillizaton condition.Results: A dosimetric measurement with home-made phantom have been developed. The special designed acrylic board domed-cones combination provide needles up to 60° rotation flexibility application. Some area that isodose curves couldn't cover in conventional parallel template could be covered now by using this new designed template.Conclusion: This special designed acrylic board domed-cones combination not only provide a reliable way for needles fixation and rotational function, but also provide a superior dose distribution in anterior portion of prostate and well coverage of seminal vesicle.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe our management of the respiration-induced uncertainty by the Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) of 4-dimensional (4D) CT.Material and Methods: Gross target volumes (GTVs) and planning target volumes (PTVs) were contoured on the images of normal-breathing CT and MIP of 4D CT for 12 patients with primary lung cancer or metastatic lung tumor. The volumes of GTVs and PTVs were compared between the two sets of images by using the paired t-test.Results: The GTVs of MIP images (mean=8.13±9.05 cm^3) were larger than those of normal breathing images (mean=4.74±5.89 cm^3, p=0.04). When applying different safe margins on GTVs to define their PTVs, the PTVs of MIP images (mean=25.28±20.38 cm^3) became smaller than those of normal breathing images (mean 75.04±36.49 cm^3, p=＜0.01). Moreover, in 3 cases whose tumors were located in the lower lung, the PTVs of normal breathing images could not fully cover the GTVs of the MIP images. On the contrary, for tumors above the carina, the differences of target volumes between the two image sets were smaller.Discussion and Conclusion: 4D CT depicts the excursion of a lung tumor and increases the accuracy of the target definition. The 4D CT-based plans can reduce the target volumes to spare more normal tissues compared with conventional plans.',\n",
       " 'We report the case of a 45-year-old man who received definitive chemoradiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Three months after chemoradiotherapy, head-and-neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple residual lymph nodes with what appeared to be metastases in the neck. However, 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) produced nonspecific findings. We performed a confirmatory modified radical neck dissection; and pathologic examination revealed metastatic carcinoma, consistent with nasopharyngeal origin. The dramatic false-negative results were obtained on FDG-PET images more than 3 months after chemoradiotherapy. We conclude that functional studies need to be interpreted with caution within short intervals after definitive chemoradiotherapy even after 3 months.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: To verify the accuracy of CyberKnife(superscript ®) Respiratory Tracking System (SRTS) in tracking the tumor motion during the respiratory cycle and the influence on treatment field; and to evaluate the clinical application of the system.\\nMaterials and Methods: The SRTS was a subsystem of the CyberKnife(superscript ®) stereotactic radiosurgery system for respiratory tracking. The motion phantom was used in the respiratory motion experiments, which can imitate regular breathing pattern. The motion phantom contained a motion table and a ball-cube phantom which can hold verification films. We performed the E2E CyberKnife(superscript ®) dose calibration procedure and used MD-55 verification film, flatbed scanner (Epson Expression 1680) and dose analysis software (Film QA) to evaluate the clinical dosimetry and treatment accuracy. The mechanical accuracy of the SRTS was tested and confirmed by three stages of studies including the static phantom, motion phantom and the motion tracking compensation experiments. We also designed two experiments with phantom moved in different phases and frequency of the respiratory cycle to test for the accuracy of the image guide system on motion compensation. The clinical dosimetry verification studies included the lung, liver and prostate cancer patients. The two dimensional dose distribution (sagittal and axial) measured by the MD-55 film was compared with the treatment planning result by a gamma comparison with pass criteria of 3%/3 mm.\\nResult: The average positional error for the static stage study was 0.42±0.06 mm. The average targeting error with and without the SRTS tracking compensation in the respiratory cycle was 0.35±0.10 mm and 7.59±5.14 mm, respectively (p＜0.0001). The difference of average targeting error between two respiratory cycles (15/min and 20/min) was 0.12 mm (p=0.11). In the verification of the axial and sagittal 2-D dose distribution of the three clinical cases, they were 99% compatible. Conclusion: The spatial positional error of SRTS was less than 0.5 mm which matched the accuracy requirement of stereotatic radiosurgery. By using the SRTS to track and compensate for the motion of lesions during respiratory cycle, we can significantly minimize the volume of the treatment field and the dose of the surrounding critical structures. The accuracy of dosimetry was also proven by our clinical cases experiments. However, additional positional error will be caused by patient who can not tolerate to the long treatment hours (1.5 to 2.5 hrs).',\n",

Patient characteristics and treatment related parameters were analyzed to correlate with overall survival and disease free survival.\\nResults: The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rate was 83% and 81.5%, respectively. The most common site of failure is pleural seeding. The univariate analyses showed that Mosaoka stage and extent of surgical resection were important prognostic factors. The 5-year overall survival rate was 95.8 % in stage Ⅱ thymoma and 71.9% in stage Ⅲ/Ⅳ thymoma (p=0.06). The 5-year survival rate was 87.3% for those who underwent complete resection compared with 44.4% for those with microscopic or gross residual disease (p=0.04). Patients receiving extended-field or involved-field radiotherapy had similar 5-year overall survival (88% versus 94.7%, p=0.53). In this study, we can not identify significant prognostic factors for disease free survival.\\nConclusion: In our study, the extent of resection is important prognostic factor for invasive thymoma.

All patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy which consisted of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (50.4 Gy) and was concomitant with bolus 5-FU (group A) or bolus 5-FU plus oral UFUR (group B). Fourteen patients were enrolled in group A; 18 patients were categorized as group B. Operation was performed 4~6 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoints were downstaging, pathological complete response (pCR) and sphincter preservation rate. The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), local recurrence rate (LRR), and disease-free survival (DFS).\\nResults: The median follow-up period for all patients was 44 months from the date of diagnosis, ranging from 15 to 59 months. The downstaging, pCR and sphincter preservation rate of all patients were 46.9%, 12.5% and 72.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference between group A and B in tumor downstaging or pCR. The 4 patients who achieved pathological complete response did not experience local recurrence or distant metastasis at the end of this study. The 4-year OS, LRR and DFS of all patients were 70.3%, 9.6% and 74.5%. No significant difference could be recorded between groups A and B in OS, LRR and DFS. Group B had more significant hematological toxicity. Grade 2 or greater GI toxicity was similar in both groups.

They were treated with surgical resection followed by radiotherapy alone or chemoradiotherapy in our hospital. A total of 60 Gy was given in 6 weeks with 3D conformal RT (3D-CRT). Fusion of planning CT with MRI was routinely used to assist target delineation. We used concomitant temozolomide (75 mg/m^2 daily up to 49 days) followed by up to six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg/m^2 daily for five days, every 28 days). Follow-up and survival times were calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last contact or death. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were computed by Kaplan-Meier methods.\\nResults: The median follow-up was 19.1 months. At the time of analysis, 10 patients were alive, 25 patients had died. The median survival rate was 19.1 months for all patients. The 3-year overall survival rates were 14% and 43% in radiotherapy alone arm and CCRT arm, respectively. (p=0.002). The 3-year progression-free survival rates were 10.6% and 13.9% in radiotherapy alone and CCRT arm, respectively. (p=0.54). In the AA group, the overall survival rates were 8.7% and 67.9% in radiotherapy alone arm and CCRT arm, respectively. (p=0.001). In the GBM group, the overall survival rates were 16.3% and 23.7% in radiotherapy alone and CCRT arm, respectively. (p=0.261). In-field failure was the major cause of failure, among 35 patients, 22 (62.8%) patients had in-field failure. All patients completed radiotherapy courses. Thirty (86%) patients had grade 1 CNS toxicity and 5 (14%) patients had grade 2 CNS toxicity. Among 21 patients who received temozolomide, 18 patients had no obvious side effects during and after chemotherapy.\\nConclusions: Addition of adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide to radiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed AA and GBM has statistically significant survival benefit especially for patients of AA with tolerable toxicity.',\n",

However, longer follow-up period and more patients are required for more meaningful long term disease control, survival, and side effect evaluation.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Position Emission Tomography (PET) is a non-invasive technique used in nuclear medicine, which provides physiological information using molecular tracers. As 3D PET data acquisition increases, random and scatter coincidence events increase relevantly. They cause a uniform distribution of background on the image and degrade the accuracy of quantitative analysis. The conventional corrections for random and scatter coincidences are achieved by the delayed window technique and Single Scatter Simulation (SSS) method. However, they increase noise and reduce image accuracy.\\nMaterial and Methods: The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of using a beam stopper (BS) for correcting non-true coincidence events. The BS placed on the line of response (LOR) at two different locations rotating with constant degrees absorbs a particular fraction of the true events. The non-true coincidence, non-blocked at the LORs by each stopper, can be estimated. Assuming that the non-true radiation is a spatially slow-varying distribution, the whole non-true sinogram can be recovered using cubic-spline interpolation from these local measurements. Beam stopper rotated (BSR) reduces the effective sampling distance without increasing the number of the stoppers. In this study, we performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for 3-D PET with the GATE software for a cold phantom to conduct the BSR method.\\nResult: The estimate of non-true event fraction in a large FOV using BSR method is 31.55% and is close to the result of Monte-Carlo simulation. The activity ratio of region approaches the initial input quantity.\\nConclusion: We conclude that the proposed correction method is effective and better than conventional correction schemes without increasing scan time. In sum, the BSR method is a convenient and effective correction for non-true coincidences in 3D PET.',\n",
       " 'Malignant lymphoma of the prostate gland, either primary or secondary, is rare. We report a 74-year-old male who was diagnosed with disseminated lymphoma including involvement of the prostate gland with the initial presentation of urinary retention. Digital rectal examination revealed mildly enlarged prostate gland with smooth and rubbery consistency. He received transurethral resection of the prostate under the impression of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The pathology found diffused infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells infiltration. The immunohistochemical staining revealed positive for CD20, and consistent with malignant B cell lymphoma. Systemic work-up found that his disease has disseminated many areas. Back mass biopsy showed small to medium atypical lymphoid cells diffused infiltration with immunohistochemical staining for CD3(-), CD5(-), CD10(+), CD20(+), CD23(-), and Cyclin D1(-). The diagnosis of follicular lymphoma was made. The patient received four cycles of chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, vincristine and prednisone (R-CEOP). After temporarily partial response, tumor regrowing was noted. Salvage chemotherapy followed by the radiotherapy (RT) to the enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes was given. The patient did not finish the RT course because of exacerbated condition. He died with the disease 9 months after diagnosis.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: Nasopharyngeal malignancies, other than squamous cell carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma, are rare. We investigated the clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes of patients with rare nasopharyngeal malignancies over a 25-year period.\\nMaterials and Methods: From January 1983 to December 2008, a total of 2113 patients with nasopharyngeal malignancies were registered in our radiotherapy database. Only seven eligible patients with rare malignancies of the nasopharynx were found. We retrospectively reviewed hospital charts, radiotherapy records, and imaging studies. The clinical courses and final outcomes were analyzed. Survival was compared with another group of patients with stage II-IVb conventional nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). treated by concomitant chemoradiotherapy.\\nResults: The incidence of rare nasopharyngeal malignancies was only 0.33%. The pathologic diagnoses were three rare carcinomas (adenocarcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma), three lymphomas and one rhabdomyosarcoma. The initial manifestations were similar to conventional NPC. Two patients were misdiagnosed with conventional NPC (undifferentiated carcinoma), but this was revised to rhabdomyosarcoma and malignant lymphoma when distant sites relapsed. The overall survival and progression-free survival of the study group were significantly worse than conventional NPC (42.9% vs. 74.8%, P=0.027; 42.9% vs. 71.7%, P=0.016, respectively).\\nConclusion: Rare malignancies arising from the nasopharynx consist of several different pathologies. The accurate diagnosis of rare malignancies of the nasopharynx depends on high index of suspicious of pathologist. The treatment outcome is worse than conventional NPC.',\n",

Twelve patients were male, and 6 patients were female. The median age of the patients at the diagnosis was 52 years old (range 28-75 years old). Fourteen patients had loco-regional disease (stage Ⅰ-Ⅱ) and 4 patients had systemic disease (stage Ⅲ-Ⅳ). A total of 5 patients received chemo therapy (C/T) only, 1 patient received radiotherapy (RT) only, and 12 patients received combination of RT and C/T.\\nResults: The median follow up period was 44 months (range from 0.4 months to 16.0 years). Twelve patients (66.7%) achieved complete response (CR) by image study, and then 6 out of the 12 patients had recurrent disease. The 5-year overall survival and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate were 55.2% and 42.2%, respectively. Up front RT resulted in better DFS for 14 patients with stage Ⅰ/Ⅱ disease (2-year DFS: RT vs. C/T: 83.3% vs. 25%, P=0.031). CR was the most potent prognostic factor affecting 5-year overall survival (CR vs. non-CR: 83.3% vs. 0%, P＜0.001) and 2-year DFS (CR vs. non-CR: 48.1% vs. 0%, P＜0.001). The International Prognostic Index score was found to independently influence only the DFS in patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma.\\nConclusion: In this study, achievement of a CR is a particularly important determinant of treatment success. In analysis the 14 patients with stage Ⅰ/Ⅱ disease, up front RT had an essential role improvement of DFS.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To measure the beam data and dosimetry parameters for Total Body Irradiation (TBI).\\nMaterials and Methods: The set of measurements consists of seven items: output ratio, tray and spoiler factors, PDD, TMR, compensator factor, beam profile and dose verification. All measurements were performed on a 6 MV photon beam of Siemens Primus Linac. Experimental setup simulated TBI treatment conditions with SSD at 480 cm, field size at 40×40 cm^2 at SAD 100 cm, and the collimator and gantry angles set to 45° and 270°, respectively. In addition, a 1 cm spoiler screen was placed in front of the phantom to increase the surface dose. The first five items of dosimetry parameters were measured with a Farmer-type ion chamber, an electrometer, a parallel- plate ion chamber and a polystyrene phantom. The beam profile was measured both with films placed on the spoiler screen and with ion chamber in a polystyrene phantom. For dose verification, TLDs were placed at twelve different sites on the patient skin during TBI treatment.\\nResults: The output ratio was 0.0466, very close to that obtained under calibration conditions after applying the inverse square correction and output factor correction for TBI treatment conditions. The tray factor, spoiler factor and the combined tray-and- spoiler factor were 0.949, 0.982 and 0.931, respectively. The discrepancy between PDD and TMR was lower than 2 %. The compensator factor was 0.045 for polystyrene thickness up to 13 cm and the thickness ratio of polystyrene to lead was 0.511. Beam profiles measured with films and ion chamber were almost the same. For dose verification, the discrepancies between TLD and prescribed dose were comparable to the intrinsic measurement uncertainty, ±5 %.\\nConclusion: A comprehensive set of beam data and dosimetry parameters were measured and all ratio discrepancies seen during the study (except TLD part), consistent with those applied clinically, were within 2 % indicating the study viable.',\n",

A conventional anterior low-neck and supercalaviculer field was performed regularly during radiotherapy. Owing to the remarkable progressing advances in linear accelerator and treatment planning system, there were a lot of achievement in radiotherapy in recent decades, the patient setup technique of radiotherapy in head and neck cancer have changed from multi-centers technique to mono-isocenter technique.\\nMaterials and Methods: Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used to place on RT-HUMANOID phantom to evaluate the skin dose of head and neck field. Multi-centers and monoisocenter techniques were performed in setup with anthropomorphic phantom during the experiment. TMR formula and Pinnacle radiotherapy planning system were used to calculate the output monitor- unit (MU).\\nResults: We found that the neck skin doses in mono-isocenter technique was calculated in treatment planning system as 6% higher than multi-centers technique when that of calculated with TMR formula. The neck skin doses of mono-isocenter were 3% higher than that of multi-centers setup technique using the same calculation method (which is Pinnacle radiotherapy planning system). The neck skin doses of Pinnacle radiotherapy planning system were 8% higher than that of TMR formula using the same setup technique (which is multi-centers).\\nDiscussions: The calculation methods and the SSD (source-surface distance) might cause the different of the neck skin doses.',\n",

       " \"Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is an uncommon cutaneous adenocarcinoma. It predominantly involves apocrine gland-bearing areas, especially the vulva, scrotum, and perianal areas. In contrast to mammary Paget's disease, extramammary Paget's disease may or may not be associated with internal malignancy. Initially, the lesion is typically erythematous, dry, and raised with pruritus. It later may turn into an eczematoid, crusted, ulcerated, or papillary lesion with pain and bleeding. Patients often give a history of prolonged treatment with topical corticosteroid and antifungal agents before a diagnosis is made by biopsy of the lesion. Extramammary Paget's disease should be highly suspected if a skin lesion fails to clear with topical steroid and antifungal treatment.\\nMany different treatment modalities have been reported, including surgery or Mohs micrographic surgery, radiotherapy, chemo-radiotherapy, topical chemotherapy and topical immune modulator. The effectiveness of radiotherapy is generally difficult to ascertain because most of the literatures comprised mostly of individual case reports.

All patients were treated by dedicated Novalis radiosurgery system coupled with ExacTrac image guided system.\\nAt first, we performed head phantom test to compare the accuracy of each setup method to predefined isocenter, and then to compare the spatial difference between these two setup methods from patients' data. Due to the software’s limitation, treatment setup can be proceeded only by one method at a time, either by stereotactic localizer box or ExacTrac image guided system, therefore, the phantom and each patient had two treatment plans of the same treatment center. We started to setup by the traditional SRS procedure first, i.e., matching the treatment center in the stereotactic localizer box from the first plan, and then we took two fixed angled oblique radiographs to check the difference between this treatment center and that from the digital reconstructed radiographs of the second treatment plan.\\nResults: In phantom's test, the setup error of stereotactic frame box with maskring is 1.1 mm in AP direction, and 1mm in lateral direction, in contrast to 0.2 mm in AP, and 0.4 mm in lateral direction by ExacTrac x-ray verification system. Patients with immobilization using headring had less displacement error, all were smaller than 1 mm or within 1 degree of rotation except in vertical direction. In contrast, immobilization using maskring had larger displacement, but all of them were smaller than 3 mm or within 2 degrees. The setup accuracy of localizer box could be affected by the reproducibility of maskring, and this factor can be corrected in ExacTrac image guided system. Conclusion : For SRS, the setup error is usually required to be within 1 mm for rapid dose fall-off outside of the target, and headring can meet this requirement; maskring, usually used in the SRT, had larger setup error, and this should be taken into account in defining treatment target. The adoption of image guided system for double-check of the treatment center could be beneficial in reducing the setup error, especially in the SRT treatment.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To study associated cancer risks by measurements from out-of-field scatter doses with IMRT techniques such as helical tomotherapy with the use of an anthropomorphic Rando phantom.\\nMaterials and Methods: A commercially available Rando phantom was placed on the treatment couch to simulate the patient treatment delivery under tomotherapy. Various calibrated TLD chips were placed at different anatomical locations for the dosimetry measurements. For nasopharyngeal cancer patient, tomotherapy was generated to deliver the radiation doses for evaluation. The clinical comparison is based on the ICRP-60 risk model analysis of critical organ doses after evaluation of the helical-IMRT techniques using 72Gy dose prescription and optimization criteria.\\nResults: Len, heart and kidney received 3.91Gy, 0.49 and 0.11Gy respectively, which were far less than their maximal tolerance dose. According to the data calculation from ICRP Publication No.60 the lung and esophagus have about 0.7~4.45% risks, the risks for others organs were 0.2~0.08%. The whole body dose and fatal cancer probability rate recevied about 0.52Sv and 2.6% respectively.\\nConclusion: Despite the overall higher M.U. delivery in tomotherapy, the overall whole body dose is lower risk probability of secondary malignancies induced by low dose radiation.',\n",

There were 23 males and 23 females with a median age of 55 years (range, 16-75). The primary sites included major salivary gland (18), sinonasal region (14), oral cavity (8), lacrimal gland (3), tongue base (2), and larynx (1). The major endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints were local failure-free survival (LFFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS).\\nResults: After a median follow-up of 157 months, 24 of 46 patients had tumor relapse (7 local, 1 regional, 2 locoregional, 9 distant, 5 local plus distant). The 5-year rates of LFFS, MFS, OS and CSS were 73.1%, 74.0%, 75.3% and 80.1%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that female gender, younger age, early stage, good performance status, major salivary gland location and shorter interval between operation and radiotherapy were favorable prognostic factors for OS (P＜0.05). The multivariate analysis revealed that performance status was the only significant prognostic factor that affected overall survival (hazard ratio, 8.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-38.64; P=0.006) and cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio, 9.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-52.10; P= 0.012).\\nConclusion: The treatment outcomes of surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy for ACC of head and neck region were good with a 5-year overall survival rate of 75.3%.

The median age at diagnosis was 54 years old (range, 4-70 years old). The prescribed total tumor doses ranging from 46 to 70Gy were delivered with a median dose of 60Gy. The median follow-up of living patients was 94.2 months (range, 25.4-245.2 months).\\nResults: Local failure developed in 4 of 9 patients. The local control rates at 3 and 5 years were both 66.7%. The overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 88.9% and 63.5%, respectively, with 5 deaths; Three deaths were disease-or treatment-related. Two patients had significant tumor regression after treatment. The 3 pediatric patients who received radiotherapy at ages 9, 4 and 5 years had relatively long overall survivals.\\nConclusion: Our study demonstrates that conventional radiotherapy has a positive impact on local tumor control of skull base chordoma, but unresectable or overt residual diseases are rarely cured.

The preoperative treatment consisted of chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil plus Leucovorin) and external-beam radiotherapy (ranged from 4140 cGy to 5940 cGy). After the CRT course, surgical intervention was performed in all of the patients. Surgical procedures included abdominoperineal resection, low anterior resection, and Hartmann's procedure. We analyzed the following factors to evaluate their impact on overall survival: age of diagnosis, gender, clinical T and N stage at initial diagnosis, pathologic T and N stage after surgery, tumor size at surgical resection, and distance of tumor from anal verge.\\nResults: The median age of diagnosis of rectal cancer was 60.3 years old (ranged from 28 to 85 years old). Local recurrence occurred in 12 patients (17.1%) and distant metastasis occurred in 27 patients (38.6%). The median follow-up duration was 42 months (ranged from 3 to 114 months). The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 89.3%, 52.9% and 36.9%, respectively. In univariate analysis, clinical T stage (p=0.0047), pathologic N stage (p=0.0023), and tumor size at surgical resection (p=0.0009) were statistically significant prognostic factors for overall survival. In multivariate analysis, clinical T stage (p=0.017), pathologic N stage (p=0.004) and tumor size at surgical resection (p＜0.001) were statistically significant prognostic factors for overall survival.\\nConclusion: We concluded that the pathological specimens with regional lymph node involvement in the patient receiving preoperative CRT is a strongly prognostic factor for overall survival. Advanced clinical T stage and bulky tumor (≥4cm) noted at surgical resection are also associated with poor overall survival. Further prospective studies which enroll more patients to evaluate the impact of pathologic lymph node status and to define the optimal management are warranted.\",\n",

The psychometric test of the questionnaire was performed and the collected sociodemographic-and medical-related variables were analyzed for their association with the outcomes of service quality and satisfaction.\\nResults: The missing rate of each question ranged 0-1.5%. The psychometric test revealed the value of Cronbach's α was adequate (range: 0.92-0.96) for each domain, with excellent results in the discriminate and convergent validity. As regards the sociodemographic variables, only those patients with a higher socioeconomic level were observed to have a significantly better expression in the service quality domain of Assurance (p=0.03) and Reliability (p=0.02). On the contrast, no significant correlation was observed between the variables of the seniority of the attending physicians, cancer stages, radiation sites, radiation techniques, or the radiation doses with the outcomes of the five service quality domains and patients' satisfaction.

       " 'Purpose In Taiwan, data regarding the long-term outcomes of radiotherapy for pediatric brain tumors are still rare. We developed an electronic registry system (ERS) that can help to establish a database, which consisted of 986 cases of primary brain tumors in children younger than 18 years of age in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from January 1975 to May 2004. In this study, we focused on the long-term outcomes of 371 available patients treated by radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: In our original cancer registry data, there were 529 pediatric brain tumor patients who underwent radiotherapy between January 1975 and May 2004. However, after reviewing the cases, only 371 cases (70.1%) were fully recorded without missing data. Profiles of radiotherapy for these patients were input into our newly established ERS. The demographic data were analyzed, including classification of tumors, gender distribution, mortality case numbers after radiotherapy, age at treatment, dose profile of radiotherapy, and proportion of patients receiving radiotherapy. For some diseases of interest, overall survival, progression-free survival and postradiotherapy failure-free survival were also analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nResults: Of the 371 patients receiving radiotherapy, treatment for medulloblastomas is the most common (n=93), followed by germinomas (n=59), astrocytomas (n=36), anaplastic astrocytomas (n=36) and brain stem tumors (n=29). The proportions of patients receiving radiotherapy for medulloblastomas, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, astrocytomas (grade Ⅱ), anaplastic astrocytomas, glioblastomas and germinomas were 70.9%, 90.4%, 48.65%, 80.0%, 41.0% and 78.6%, respectively. The pooled mortality rate of all diseases after radiotherapy was 43.93%. The five-year overall survival rates of medulloblastomas, astrocytomas (grade Ⅱ), anaplastic astrocytomas and germinomas were 81.73%, 71.49%, 25.34% and 88.94%, respectively. The 5-year progression-free survival of medulloblastomas was 66.46%. Additionally, seven patients (1.89%) suffered from radiation-induced secondary tumors after completion of radiotherapy for a period of time (range, 2.8 to 24 years; median, 19.7 years).\\nConclusion: An electronic registry system can help to facilitate the statistical analysis for rare pediatric brain tumor data. Our demographic and survival analyses were mostly comparable with those of previous studies. The database of pediatric brain tumors is worthy continuing to provide materials for further studies.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To report our initial experience with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).\\nMaterials and Methods: Between May 2005 and July 2008, 58 patients underwent definitive IMRT for NPC in the Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Taipei Branch. There were 17 females and 41 males, with a median age of 51.5 (range 27-88). The disease was Stage Ⅰ in 3 (5%), Stage Ⅱ in 12 (21%), Stage Ⅲ in 29 (50%), and Stage Ⅳ in 14 (24%). IMRT was delivered using a dynamic multileaf collimator. Thirty-one patients received concomitant cisplatin and 5FU, and seventeen patients received concomitant cisplatin. Among them, thirty-one patients received adjuvant cisplatin and 5-FU chemotherapy. The prescribed dose was 66-72 Gy to the gross tumor volume and positive neck nodes, 46.8-50 Gy to the clinically negative neck. Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) radiation morbidity scoring criteria. The local control, local-regional control, distant metastasis-free, and the overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nResults : With a median follow-up of 19.3 months (range 7 to 41 months), there were 11 local recurrences at the primary site. Seven patients failed in the neck. Seven patients developed distant metastases; 6 of these patients died. The 2-year local control, local-regional control, and distant metastases-free rates were 78%, 74%, and 85% respectively. The 2-year overall survival was 86%. With 11 and 13 patents experiencing local and locoregional failure, only stage of disease was a significant predictor by multivariate analysis. IMRT with concomitant cisplatin and 5FU had treatment outcomes similar to IMRT with concomitant cisplatin alone, but this regimen was associated with more severe acute toxicity. At 19.3 months (median) after IMRT, 7% of the patients had Grade 3 xerostomia, 41% had Grade 2, 26% had Grade 1 and 2% had no xerostomia.\\nConclusion: Our preliminary results using IMRT for treatment of NPC were reported. Further study to compare concomitant cisplatin and 5FU with cisplatin alone is warranted. A larger case number and longer follow-up time were needed to confirm our preliminary results.',\n",

However, we also created a 2nd plan (Hybrid 2nd plan) for the 1st CT images to assume if no 2nd plan CT images were available.\\nResults: The reductions of body contours are highly correlated with the body weight loss of the patients. The parotid glands decrease in size no matter the patients had significant body weight loss or not. When comparing the dosimetric effects of Hybrid and New 2nd plan, there were no significant dosimetric differences of target coverage. However, increases in the doses of normal tissue such as brainstem, spinal cord, left and right parotid glands were noted. In the subgroup analysis, there were significant increase of spinal cord, brainstem, R't parotid gland doses and hot spots in PTV(subscript CTV1) for patients with significant body weight loss. For patients without significant body weight loss, there were increases of spinal cord and brainstem doses but the target dose coverage remained satisfactory.\\nConclusions: We conclude that the volume of parotid glands decreased significantly during the course of IMRT even in patients without significant body weight loss. A 2nd plan CT and a new 2nd IMRT plan based on the new CT scan are needed for the IMRT treatment of NPC.\",\n",
       " 'Introduction: By using image-guided correction, we analyzed the dose coverage of planning target volume (PTV) and surrounding normal tissues impacted by radiation dose retrospectively. This was done on head and neck (H&N) cancer patients who were not guided by imaging based on the effective treatment results of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).\\nMaterial and Methods : 20 patients underwent image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) resulted in a total of 386 paired images which were analyzed by software to acquire the correction shifts in three axis, followed by recalculation of a treatment plan system. The effect of PTV and normal tissue irradiation volume were evaluated by plan summation.\\nResults: The average correction shift of anterior-posterior (AP), medial-lateral (RL) and cranio-caudal (CC) directions were -0.4±0.9 mm, -0.4±1.2 mm and -0.1±0.7 mm, respectively. The systematic and random errors in AP direction were 0.9 mm and 0.9 mm, in RL direction were 0.7 mm and 0.9 mm, in SI direction were 1.2 mm and 1.1 mm. The average vector shift was 2.1±0.3 mm with 88% probability of being less than 3 mm.\\nIn brain and H&N tumor groups, the PTV missing probability of V90 (the volume covered by 90% isodose curve), V95 (the volume covered by 95% isodose curve) and V107 (the volume covered by 107% isodose curve) were 0.15% and 0.17%, 0.37% and 0.39%, 0.03% and 0.31%, respectively. On the other hand, in brain and H&N tumor groups, the probabilities of normal tissue being irradiated were as follows: 0.25±1.36% of left eye, 1.18±0.81% of brain stem, -0.22±0.63% of spinal cord, left 0.15±0.77% of parotid gland, -0.09±1.16% of right eye and -0.21±0.8% of right parotid gland.\\nConclusion: The dose coverage of PTV and normal tissue risk can be kept within the acceptable range by adding the safety margin recommended by Marcel van Herk (2.5Σ±0.7σ) mm along with the control of the setup error of less than 3 mm and the space vector shift of less than 5.2 mm.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: Epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma mainly invades skin tissues. In the clinic, we often use bolus to increase the surface dose. To evaluate the patients of epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma who had lesions on either single foot or on both feet skins, Gafchromic EBT film was used as in-vivo dosimetry to compare two different radiotherapy methods and verified the skin doses.\\nMaterials and Methods: In these two different treatment methods, we used 2×2 cm^2 size EBT film to measure the skin dose. The first method treated both feet. Two feet were immersed in a water tank and irradiated with 10 MV bilateral photon beam. The total dose of 36 Gy was delivered in 12 fractions. The second method treated only partial single foot, and used the Alpha cradle fixation system. In this study, we used at least 3mm thick Polyflex II as the tissue-compensator. Base on CT images, the treatment site was irradiated with 4 MV photon beams at 4 different angles. The total dose of 50 Gy was delivered in 25 fractions. The treatment planning system used in this study was Philips pinnacle^3 v7.6c.\\nResults: In both-feet irradiation case, we chose twelve points and repeated measurement for 5 days. The average skin dose of both feet was 313.3±15.7 cGy. In single foot irradiation case, two measure points were repeated for 10 days. The average skin dose at points A and B were 219.5±4.1 cGy and 219.0±5.5 cGy respectively. The calculation results of treatment planning at A and B points were 212.7 cGy and 216.7 cGy respectively. The measurement results were higher than the treatment planning system by 3.2% and 1.1%.\\nConclusions: As shown by the results of this study, either water tank or polyflex II may be used as tissue-compensators. They can provide sufficient doses to the skin tissue. Both methods are available for follow-up evaluation.\",\n",
       " 'Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma arising from head and neck is extremely rare. We report a 51-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of right external auditory canal. A wide excision surgery was performed. Right side neck lymph node metastasis was found after operation. She underwent chemotherapy with 6 courses of cisplatin and etoposide. The posttreatment CT scan of head and neck disclosed complete remission of lymphadenopathy and no local recurrence of primary tumor. Then she received local radiotherapy using IMRT technique with 60 Gy in 30 fractions to tumor bed and 54 Gy in 30 fractions to regional lymphatics. The treatment course of radiation was completed smoothly. However, the patient developed liver metastases during the radiotherapy course and then died 12 months after the initial diagnosis. We believe that although radiotherapy have benefit for local control, chemotherapy is of the most importance for extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma.',\n",

However, the clinical symptom with pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma is not specific. Physician easily missed the diagnosis if other infection coexisted.\\nHere we describe a case who had been diagnosed with HIV infection. The patient developed pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma proved pathologically 4 years later. A 42 years old man had diagnosis of HIV in 2002 and treated suboptimally with medication in another hospital. Unfortunately, productive cough with whitish sputum and hyperpigmentation macules over left lower leg occurred in April, 2007. Opportunistic pulmonary infection was first diagnosed due to severe immune deficiency situation even though there was no positive finding in the examination. CT guided biopsy had been performed resulting in interstitial pneumonitis initially.\\nThe respiratory symptoms improved after prophylactic antibiotics treatment and anti-HIV medication. However, macules over his leg aggravated 2 months later and treated by amputation. Kaposi's sarcoma of left leg was diagnosed according to histologic pattern. After reviewing the previous lung biopsy, AIDS-associated KS of left leg with lung metastasis was finally diagnosed. We also review the liturature to discuss epidemiology, incidence, clinical symptoms, pathogenesis, diagnostic methods and treatments. Concomitant pulmonary infection may underlying pulmonary KS. In addition, the lesions in the lung may be subtle. Physician should be alert of the existence of pulmonary KS and opportunistic infection, especially in patients who had already known to have extrapulmonary KS.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: Oncocytomas are very rare tumors that are usually benign and typically occur in the parotid gland. Oncocytic carcinomas are even more uncommon, comprising only approximately 5% of all oncocytomas. In a critical review of the international medical literature, only a few cases of oncocytic carcinoma of submandibular gland were found. Even more unusual was the fact in this case, it arose from a previously benign oncocytoma. We describe this case of submandibular oncocytoma transforming into a malignancy associated with regional lymph node metastases.\\nPatient and Methods: A rare case of 51 year-old man with malignant oncocytoma is presented. The tumor was found in the left submandibular gland with regional lymph node enlargement.\\nResults and Conclusion: Oncocytic carcinoma appears to arise from benign oncocytomas, or may also arise de novo. In oncocytic carcinoma of the head and neck, the presence of distant, rather than local lymph node, metastasis is the most important prognostic indicator. Therapy consists of surgical resection and radiotherapy but the efficacy of radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are still unclear.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To define the incidence and risk of the second primary malignancies (SPM) in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) post radiotherapy in our hospital. We also analyze their prognosis after the SPM\\nMaterials and Method: Between April 1971 and April 2009, 1367 patients were indentified to have NPC after definitive radiotherapy. Of them, 45 patients developed SPM. They received various treatment strategies including surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, concurrent chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. Radiotherapy technique included conventional radiotherapy, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).\\nResults: The most common site for a SPM was the head and neck region, lung, liver and leukemia & lymphoma in decreasing order. The median time to development of SPM was 94 months. The crude incidence was 3.3%. The 20-year cumulative rate of development of SPM was 16.7%. Older patient has a higher incidence of 39.1%. The incidence between patients who received conventional radiotherapy and those having 3DCRT or IMRT is not significantly different (p=0.666). There is no significant difference for survival in NPC with or without SPM (p=0.245).\\nConclusions: Head and neck cancer is the most common second cancer in NPC patients after radiotherapy. There is a trend to the development of SPM in the older age groups (＞50 years old)',\n",
       " 'Purpose: We performed this retrospective analysis to evaluate prognostic factors and short-term outcome for patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma receiving definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).\\nMaterial and Method: This study included 142 patients who underwent definitive IMRT at National Taiwan University Hospital between December 2003 and December 2006. The median dose to the clinical target volume was 78 Gy (range: 73.1-82.3 Gy) in daily fractions of 1.91-2.11 Gy. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy was given to 136 patients, usually starting 1 to 3 months before IMRT. The survival outcome was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses were made with Log-rank test and Cox regression, respectively, on potential prognostic factors for survival.\\nResults: The median follow-up time was 24.3 months. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 95.4%. The 2-year failure-free survival (FFS), biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates for the whole cohort were 87.1%, 85.9%, and 97.6%, respectively. The 2-year FFS and BFFS were adversely influenced by T stage, Gleason score (GS) ＞7, and initial PSA (iPSA) serum level ＞20 ng/mL. The 2-year DMFS was adversely influenced by T stage, and GS ＞7. Multivariate analyses show that T stage is an independent factor for BFFS (p=.040), and FFS (p=.050), and that GS is an independent factor for DMFS (p=.037). Among the 17 patients with biochemical failure, the interval between PSA nadir and biochemical failure correlated significantly with 2-year DMFS (≤6 months 50.0% vs. ＞6 months 84.6%, p=.049). The rate of acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities was 16.8% and 14%, respectively. The rate of late grade 2 GI and GU toxicities was 12.6% and 6.3%, respectively. Three patients (2.1%) developed late grade 3 GI toxicities. The use of a rectal balloon significantly reduced≥grade 3 late GI toxicity (without balloon it was 7.14% vs. with, 0 %, p=.046).\\nConclusion: Patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma undergoing definitive IMRT had T stage, initial PSA, and GS as significant prognostic factors for BFFS and FFS. T stage, GS, and the interval between PSA nadir and biochemical failure were prognostic factors for DMFS.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This research was focused on the reliability of measured tool for the skin dose in vivo of the head-and-neck patients treated with radiation. To establish the relationship of the dose ratio of the surface and Dmax, and this data can be used as references for c1inical applications.\\nMaterials and Method: This experiment adopted Harshaw cylindrical TLD, Markus parallel ion chamber and ISP Gafchromic EBT film as the measured tool to establish the characteristics and buildup region. Target contoured were under the skin surface, equal to the skin surface and over the skin surface respectively. This research will establish the relationship of the dose ratio of the surface (D0) and 1 cm depth from skin (D1) when D1 of the measurement is similar to that calculated by the treatment planning system. D0/D1 is expected to predict the actual absolute received dose.\\nResult: In this experiment the variance coefficient of TLD was within 3%. The reading values and delivered doses were in a good linear relationship. The points on calibration curve of Gafchromic film were within 5% and in a stable performance. In additiol1, D1 of Gafchromic film compared to that calculated by the treatment planning system was similar and the errors were all within 5%. Thus, the dose ratio (D0/D1) of the measured surface dose and calculated dose with 1 cm depth from skin could be used to calculate the approximate skin dose. The measured skin dose for most of the head-and-neck patients with the target contoured over or equal to the skin surface was around 85%~95% of D1; whereas with the target contoured 4 mm under the skin surface, the measured skin dose was around 67%-68% of D1.\\nConclusion and Discussion: From the experimental results, the proximity of the target contour to the skin indeed affects the skin dose received from radiation treatment. D0/D1, can be used as references for clinical applications.',\n",

In the SCRT group, patients received pre-operative 5×5 Gy with immediate surgery. In the CCRT group, patients received a total dose of 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy per fraction) concomitantly with two courses of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin followed by delayed surgery.\\nResults: Among the 88 patients, 38 received SCRT and 50 received CCRT. All patients received curative surgery. A R0 resection was performed in 97% and 98% of patients received SCRT and CCRT respectively. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 100% and 98% of patients received SCRT and CCRT respectively. A higher tumor response rate was observed in the CCRT group (downstage 40%) as compared with SCRT group (downstaging 29%). With a median follow-up time of 19 months, local failure developed in 6 of 88 (7%) and distant metastases occurred in 16 of 88 (18%). The 2-year overall survival (OS) are comparable between these two groups (OS: SCRT-96.0% vs. CCRT-86.9%, p=0.48). In terms of disease-free survival (DFS), patients in the SCRT group have borderline significant better 2-year DFS as compared with CCRT group (DFS: SCRT-82.4% vs. CCRT-62.4%, p=0.06).\\nConclusion: Pre-operative SCRT and CCRT are equally effective in terms of the resectability and sphincter preservation in stage II-III rectal cancer. A higher tumor response (downstaging and complete tumor response) was noted in the CCRT group. The long term results of overall tumor control and survivals between these two groups still need longer follow-up time to disclose.',\n",

The radiation dose was 24 Gy in 5 fractions and the target volume was focused on the tumor involved hepatic hilum. All patients had bilirubin data 2 weeks before EBRT and 1 month after EBRT. The decreased bilirubin (De-Bil) group included patients whose bilirubin after EBRT was lower than bilirubin before EBRT, and the patients in increased bilirubin (In-Bil) group had bilirubin after EBRT equal to or higher than before. The survival times were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis.\\nResults: The bilirubin was decreased after EBRT in 48.8% of patients. In all clinical features, there were no significant differences between the De-Bil and In-Bil groups by the chi-square test. The median survival was 4.4 months in the De-Bil group and 1.0 month in the In-Bil group, respectively (p＜0.001). The De-Bil group had significantly better survival than the In-Bil group according to Child-Pugh class, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, Okuda stage, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score, and Japan Integrated Staging (JIS) score. In multivariate analysis, the bilirubin change was the most significant factor associated with survival (HR: 34.314, p＜0.001). In treatment response evaluation by follow-up images, the De-Bil group had better response than the In-Bil group in available patients.\\nConclusion: Decrease of bilirubin level after EBRT indicates a better survival and is related to a better response in image study. Local EBRT to HCC invading hepatic hilum shows prolonged survival in radiation responsive patients.',\n",

Treatment plans with non-equal weighted 4-field technique (AP/ PA 20%/20% and R/L 30%/30%) were done and the dose-volume histograms for small bowel were compared with equal weighted 4-field technique. D50 was defined as the volume difference isodose curve between equal and non-equal weighting technique. D50R was defined as the ratio of D50 to small-bowel volume of equal weighting technique. We tried to correlated D50 or D50R with age and body mass index (BMI) with correlation and multiple linear regression.\\nResults: The non-equal weighting technique achieved maximum small-bowel volume reduction at 50% isodose level (p＜0.001). D50 was correlated with age (R=0.623, p＜0.001) and BMI (R=0.610, p＜0.001). D50R was correlated with BMI (R=0.726, p＜0.001). On multiple linear regression, age (p＜0.001) and BMI (p＜0.001) were independent factors of D50. BMI (p＜0.001) was the only independent factor of D50R.\\nConclusion: Treatment plans using non-equal-weighted treatment plans with smaller weighting in the antero-posterior direction can reduce small-bowel volume in patients with gynecologic malignancies, especially in those with high BMI.',\n",

In this present study, we investigated the radioprotective effect of San B and its related mechanism.\\nMaterial and Methods: Cytotoxicity of pre-exposure to San B 72 hrs on Chang liver cell was measured by MTT assay. The radiation-induced apoptosis of Chang liver cell pretreated with San B at 40 μM for 24 hours followed by irradiation 15 Gy was assessed by flow cytometry and Western Blot test. The antioxidative activity of Chang liver cells pretreated with San B 40 μM for 4 hours followed by irradiation was evaluated by Glutathione Assay Kit.\\nResults: A significant increase in mean survival viability (31.4±13.6%) of Chang liver cell irradiated after pre-exposure to San B at 40 μM was observed as compared to corresponding irradiated alone controls (22.6±9.6%, p＜0.05) by MTT assay. The sub G1 population of Chang liver cells, pretreated with San B at 40 μM followed by irradiation, was 5% compared to 12% in radiation alone group (p＜0.05). The antioxidative activity of Chang liver cells pretreated with San B 40 μM followed by irradiation also significantly increased the intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels in comparison with radiation alone group. Furthermore, Western blotting showed that pretreatment with San B 40 μM significantly down-regulated p53 and Bax, suppressing expression of caspases-9 and caspases-3 after irradiation. However, no effect on the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was found, suggesting that the radioprotective effect of San B is mediated by inhibition of p53-mediated apoptotic pathway.\\nConclusion: Our results suggest that San B has a radioprotective effects on Chang liver cells. Its action mechanism involves both elevation of antioxidative activity and inhibition of radiation-induced apoptosis.',\n",

       " 'Although the use of conformal radiotherapy techniques has been extensively accepted for treatment of malignancies, the current dosimetry data were from measurement in phantom, not in human body. Herewith we reported a case of T1 laryngeal cancer suffered from conformal radiotherapy-related laryngeal necrosis. The pathological validation of necrosis and reevaluation of dose distribution were assessed to prove the above concept as for in vivo dosimetry in irradiated patients. Our analysis shows a close correlation of the high dose volume and the necrotic volume, indicating a possible causal relationship. This might provide a proof of concept that conformal radiotherapy in current practice did target the targeted volumes with correlative biological effects including both tumor control and radiation necrosis. However, this conclusion definitely needs more cases to validate it. Further evaluation of more advanced radiotherapy techniques by using this research model could be considered to strengthen our belief in targeting the target volumes.',\n",

We retrospectively reviewed the treatment outcome and pattern of failure in the HL patients treated with local radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in a single institution.\\nMaterials and Methods: From 1997 to 2007, there were 63 adult HL patients treated in the department of radiation oncology. Radiotherapy treatment field was designed by the same radiation oncologist and tailored to the initially involved (lymphoid) region with or without the first echelon lymphatic. The pattern of failure, event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and associated prognostic factors were analyzed.\\nResults: There were 29 (46%) female and 34 (54%) male patients. Median age was 29 years old. Patients younger than 50 years old showed a much better EFS and OS (5-year EFS 81% and 46% respectively, p 0.004; 5-year OS 85% and 57% respectively, p=0.002).

Other significant poor prognostic factors for EFS included the presence of bulky disease (p=0.036) and equal to or more than 4 involved sites (p=0.036). Complete response (CR) to chemotherapy was a better prognostic factor for OS (p=0.035). In this study, favorable early stage HL showed a significant better EFS and OS, whereas unfavorable early stage HL showed a similar EFS and OS as advanced HL (5-year EFS 100%, 59% and 64% respectively, p=0.003; 5-year OS 100%, 65% and 76% respectively, p=0.014). There were 11 cases of relapses after radiotherapy.

The poor prognostic factors for OS were age at diagnosis (≥50), the presence of B symptoms, and not achieving CR after chemotherapy. The poor 5-year EFS and OS in unfavorable early stage HL suggested a more intensified treatment should be considered.\",\n",
       " 'Introduction: Primary breast sarcomas are rare tumors that account for less than 1% of primary breast neoplasms. Angiosarcoma is predominantly found in breast sarcomas. Angiosarcoma is an aggressive malignancy in which malignant cells express the properties of endothelial cells. Because of its rarity, the management and outcome of angiosarcoma patients has not been clearly described. In the past 20 years, there have been only two primary breast angiosarcomas treated in our hospital.\\nMaterials and Methods: Here we report on two cases of primary breast angiosarcoma with different presentations and treatment strategies. One underwent total mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. The other one underwent modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection.\\nResult: The prognosis for primary breast sarcoma is highly dependent on the tumor size; higher grade and positive margins increase the risk of local recurrence and thus a decreased survival rate. One patient completed the adjuvant radiotherapy in January 2008 because of the larger tumor bed. The other one underwent surgery only due to the fact that the small lesion was still disease-free after almost 3 years.\\nConclusion: The treatment of choice for angiosarcoma is surgery with adequate margins. Axillary dissection is not indicated because nodal metastasis is rare. The definitive role of adjuvant therapy remains undetermined. Due to the high locoregional recurrent rate of this disease, local therapy should be optimized with multimodality treatment. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may play an important role in survival.',\n",
       " 'Objective: For some reasons, cancer patients treated by radiotherapy (RI) experienced miss-appointment, which reduced the utility of treatment machines and affected the appointment schedule of other patients. Io optimize the treatment utility, we investigated the factors associated with patient miss-appointment during RT.\\nMethods: We prospectively and consecutively enrolled 505 cancer patients treated at the department of radiation oncology in our hospital from July 1 to December 31 in 2006. The questionnaire concerning the reasons of miss-appointment was documented and the sociodemographic and cancer- related data of patients were reviewed. Logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis.\\nResults: There were 169 cases experiencing at least one miss-appointment during the RT course. The total miss-appointment number was 330, with a miss-appointment rate of 4.58+1.27%. Concerning the sociodemographic and cancer-related factors, we found patients with annual income below 10 million NTD (aOR=9.69, 95% CI=1.26-74.37), in-patients (aOR=1.70, 95% CI=1.11-2.62), and those treated with RI dose below 3000 cGy (aOR = 2.15, 95% CI=1.30-3.56) experienced more miss-appointment rate compared with the counterparts. Feeling ill was the most common (48.5%) reason of miss-appointment.\\nConclussion: Some factors were found to be associated with patient miss-appointment during RT. We suggest a 5% over-appointment rate to maximize the treatment utility, and to educate and pay more medical care to patients with a high risk of miss-appointment.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The aim of this study is to present a novel technique in which uniform dose to the whole body as well as the soles and vertex of scalp can be achieved in one electron beam treatment fraction. An experiment was undertaken with a home-made aswirl board that enables the patient to lie in supine or prone position for treatment.\\nMaterial and Methods: A 6 MeV nominal electron beam was delivered using Elekta Precise Sli throughout this experiment. The patient is treated at a isocenter to skin distance of 350 cm. The largest field size available at SSD 100 cm is 40x40cm^2 and a high dose rate of 3000 MU min^(-1) was used. A 0.6 cm thick acrylic beam spoiler was placed 90cm away from the surface of the patient to scatter the electron beam for a more homogeneous surface dose. Patients are treated with two groups in prone and supine position by leaning on inner rotational board in prone and supine position, each group can further be separated into two subgroup with tilting and rotation positions for treatment. By incorporating all these seeting on the aswirl board with the optimal gantry angle, the patient will final accumulate compensated dosages on whole body surface.\\nResults: One of the gantry beam was directed 15.5° upward and the other 15.5° downward from the horizontal axis to provide a field size as large as 200 cm in height and 140cm in width. An incline angle of 31.50° anteriorly (forward) or posteriorly (backward) of the middle frame and an angle rotated 60° clockwise or counterclockwise of the inner frame is found to be most appropriate. The output dose rate for the AB-TSET was 0.085 cGy/mu at SSD 350 cm. The beam characteristics of the AB-TSET depth dose curves were R50=1.25cm, d(subscript max)=0.6 cm E0=2.913 MeV, R(subscript p)=1.75 cm.\\nConclusion: The AB-TSET technique presented in this study is able to deliver a uniform dose to the patient’s skin surface as well as to the vertex and the soles all in one time, eliminating the troubles of having to further boost fields for these two regions when using the Stanford Six Field Technique.',\n",
       " 'A 53-year-old Asian woman with plasma cell myloma with IgG/kappa stage IIIa post chemotherapy was selected for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Total marrow irradiation (TMI) tomotherapy was planned as a preconditioning regimen of HCT. A total dose of 800 cGy (200 cGy/ fraction) was delivered to the bone marrow. More than 10 months post transplant without evidence of active disease for the patient was noted. Except for Grade 1 nausea and vomiting there were no significantly adverse effects during TMI. The preconditioning regimen for the bone marrow transplant with helical tomotherapy targeting the bone marrow of the whole body is potentially less toxic and as efficacious in the patient. Antiemetics should be prescribed for the whole course of TMI for emesis prevention.',\n",
       " \"Kimura's disease is a rare disease and usually afflicts Oriental population, especially the young gentleman. Patients are commonly presented with painless neck mass, eosinophilia and increased serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) in examination. Although its nature is a chronic inflammation, patients may have disfigurement because of the huge neck mass. Surgical excision and postoperative steroid is the first choice of treatment. However, the local recurrent rate is high after surgery alone, and rapid rebound after discontinuing steroid frequently occurrs even the initial response is good. By our best search, we did not find any report describing the treatment outcome of radiotherapy in Kimura's disease in Taiwan and therefore we reported our experiences in three cases with four times of treatment. Rapid regression was observed during the radiotherapy, and long-term local control rate was 50%. One patient had local relapse seven years after first radiotherapy, and obvious response was noted when re-irradiation was performed. Our limited experiences and literature review suggest radiotherapy should be used in patients whose disease was not controlled by first-line treatment.\",\n",

       " 'Malignant myoepithelioma, a rare tumor mostly located in the parotid gland, accounts for less than 1% of salivary gland neoplasms. Here, we report a case of malignant soft palate myoepithelioma. A 36-year-old woman had a painless mass over the soft palate for 4 years: she first visited our hospital in May 1998; received a biopsy; and was initially diagnosed with pleomorphic adenoma. After local excision of the tumor in September 1998, the myoepithelioma was confirmed. Lymph nodes over the right submandibular area were subsequently identified in 2001. Using fine needle aspiration, undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma of nasopharyngeal origin was ascertained. The patient underwent a course of concurrent chemoradiotherapy ending in December 2001. Four months later, residual lymph nodes were excised. The tumor cells were diagnosed as malignant myoepithelioma. A CT scan in January 2005 showed a mass lesion in the right maxillary sinus and palate. Wide excision confirmed the diagnosis of recurrent malignant myoepithelioma. A further CT scan in October 2007 showed a mass involving the right maxillary sinus. After wide excision, local recurrence was confirmed. Local radiotherapy in a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions was initiated and ended in January 2008. Eight months later, a CT scan asserted a mass in the right aryepiglottic fold. After excision, recurrent malignant myoepithelioma was confirmed. This patient was free of the disease in the last OPD follow-up in February 2009.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To investigate the association of primary tumor volume by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T-stage, and its prognostic influence on patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).\\nMaterials and Methods: From February 2000 to May 2002, 69 biopsy-proven NPC; stage Ⅲ/Ⅳ disease, no distant metastasis and with available pre-treatment MRI were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received 10-weekly neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by conventional fractionated radiotherapy of 70-74 Gy. The minimal follow- up time was 5 years. The primary tumor volume was delineated on the axial slides of T2-weighted images without contrast and calculated by the Eclipse(superscript TM) treatment planning software, Local-failure-free survival (LFFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nResults: The primary tumor volume for all patients ranged from 5.46 to 137.40 cm^3 with a median value of 17.12 cm^3 and a mean value of 25.36 cm^3. The primary tumor volume had positive correlation with T-stage. The median volume for T1-2, T3 and T4 tumors were 9.91 cm^3, 13.90 cm^3, and 27.26 cm^3, respectively (p＜0.0001). Five-year LFFS (90.6% vs. 87.1%, p=0.5056), DMFS (65.7% vs. 76.8%,: p-0.3656) and 05 (74.3% vs. 70.1%, p=0.9026) were not statistically different in patients with large : (volume 17 cm^3) and small (volume≧17 cm^3) primary tumor volume. The results are similar when the cutoff value is changed from the median to the mean values (≧and＜25 cm^3). When other cutoff values are used, the differences still don't achieve statistical significance.\\nConclusion: The primary tumor volume measured on T2-weighted non-contrast: enhanced MAI had positive correlation with T-staging but did not influence the prognosis of advanced NPC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: To investigate the value of pretreatment computed tomography (CT) volumetric analysis for the prediction of primary tumor control in patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) treated by definite radiotherapy (RT), or concurrent chemoradiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: From January 2002 through December 2006, 65 patients with OPC were enrolled for this retrospective analysis. The tonsillar fossa was the principal site in 51 cases, whereas the soft palate in 14 patients. All patients received daily dose of 1.8 Gy to a total dose of 68.4 Gy to 78 Gy (median; 70.2 Gy). Concurrent chemotherapy was given to 54 patients. Primary tumor volume (pGTV) was contoured using the CT simulation and the volume was calculated by the planning system. Primary tumor relapse-free survival (PRFS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox's proportional hazard model.\\nResult: With a median follow-up of 26 months (range, 6-52 months), the 3 year PRFS was 90% for T1-2 disease and 46 % for T3-4 disease (p=0.003). The measured pGTV values ranged from 3.17 to 242.59 ml (mean, 49.33 ml). The 3 year PRFS was 82% for those with pGTV＜30 ml and 38% when pGTV were≧30 ml (p=0.001): Multivariate analysis of PRFS revealed two poor prognosis factor: pGTV≧30 ml (p=0.007, Hazard ratio: 6.6), and age≧50 years old (p=0.000, Hazard ratio: 10.6).\\nConclusion: Pretreatment CT-based primary tumor volumes are a strong predictor of local control for OPC treated by definitive RT. Primary tumor volumes≧30 ml are associated with higher relapse rate.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To analyze the treatment outcome of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.\\nMaterial and Method: After April 2002, adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was suggested for our patients with gastric adenocarcinoma of stage Ⅱ, Ⅲ, and Ⅳ (MO) after gastrectomy. Until April 2005, thirty-one patients received adjuvant CCRT with median dose of 45 Gy (ranged from 14.4 to 50.4 Gy). The other thirty-five patients in this period had no other treatment after radical surgery.\\nResults Multivariate analysis of Cox regression showed the factors of stages, treatment methods, and surgical dissection (D1 or D2) were significant prognostic factors for survival rate. By using Kaplan-Meier methods, the 3-year survival and local control rates in adjuvant CCRT group were 61.3% and 76.4%, and the 3-year survival and local control rates in operation alone group were 40% and 47.9% (significantly lower, log-rank p＜0.05). The most common severe acute toxicity in the adjuvant CCRT group was gastro-intestinal (GI) grade Ⅲ complication according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group for acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Six out of 31 patients with CCRT (19.4%) had the grade Ⅲ G1 acute side effect.\\nConclusion: Adjuvant CCRT after radical gastrectomy might significantly improve survival and local control in patients with gastric adenocarcinonia of stage Ⅱ, Ⅲ, and Ⅳ (MO) in our experience.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To analyze the treatment results of the patients with esophageal cancer after radiotherapy (RT) alone or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and identify possible prognostic factors.\\nMethods and Materials: Between February 1997 and February 2007, we treated 118 patients who had previously untreated esophageal carcinoma using definitive RT alone or CCRT. Fifty-two patients (44.1%) underwent RT alone and 66 patients (55.9%) underwent CCRT. Radiotherapy was delivered with conventional technique in 58 patients, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) in 56 patients, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMAT) in 4 patients. The median dose of RT was 59.4 Gy. Survival rates were calculated from the end of the radiotherapy with the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nResults: The median follow-up was 4 months for all patients and 25 months for those alive. Ten patients were alive, 102 patients died, and 6 patients were lost to follow-up. The 4-year overall survival of all patients were 8.2%. The 4-year overall survival of the patients in the RT alone and the CORT arm was 2.7% and 13.8%, respectively (p=0.188). The 4-year overall survival rate of stage Ⅱ, Ⅲ, and Ⅳ Was 9%, 14.6%, and 0%, respectively (p=0.045). There is no survival benefit for patient treated with 3DCRT or IMRT compared with conventional technique. A higher pretreatment hemoglobin (10 gm/dl or more) resulted in a better survival (p=0.001). In multivariate analysis, stage, CCRT, pretreatment hemoglobin, and completion of RT course were significant predictors of survival (p=0.033, 0.046, 0.032, ＜0.001, respectively). Adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy did not increase treatment mortality and morbidity. Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT)/IMRT decreased incidence of radiation pneumonitis compared with conventional technique (p=0.011).\\nConclusions: There is a trend for a better survival in the CCRT group and adding chemotherapy did not bring more toxicities. Higher pretreatment hemoglobin, early stage, CCRT, completion of AT course were significant predictors of better survival. New AT technique with 3DCRT/IMRT did not offer survival benefit, but decreased incidence of radiation pneumonitis.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Dose analysis is important for biological cell irradiation study. When cell irraiation was performed by using a high energy radiotherapy Linac, the dose uncertainties caused by the inhomogeneity structures of the cell containers make it difficult to estimate the cell dose. In this study, cell doses were measured and analysised for different setup conditions.\\nMaterials and Methods: 6 MV, 10 MV photon beams and 10 MeV, 12 MeV, 15 MeV electron beams generated by Electa SL-18 Linac were used in this study. Field sizes of 20×20 cm^2 for photon beams and 25×25 cm^2 for electron beams were designed to have a fully side scatter condition. Dosimetry analyses for AP and PA directions were performed for 86 mm×l9.5 mm Polystyrene petri dish, 25 cm^2×24.3 mm and 75 cm^2×36.5 mm Tissue Culture Flask. Extra thin TLDs (0.1 mm) were used for dose measurements. The cell irradiation condition is similar to the inhomogeneity distribution in a human body. GET (Coefficient of Equivalent Thickness) is used to evaluation the dose distribution which beyond the inhomogeneity structures. The dose variations for calculation and measurement were analyzed in different setup conditions.\\nResults and Discussion: In AP setup, the calculation dose was consistent for electron beams, within 3%, but was under estimated for both of photon beams, maximum variation of 7% in 6 MV and 5% in 10 MV. In PA setup, the calculation doses were under estimated for electron and photon beams, and are more significant for higher photon energy and larger air cavity. The depth dose distribution in buildup region is much sharper for photon beam than electron beam. This behavior makes a smaller dose variation in electron beams than in photon beams when evaluated position is located at the buildup area.',\n",

Using the RTOG classification, the patient skin-reaction was assessed once a week. We also obtained the global maximum dose and the treatment monitor unit from the patient's treatment plan. The treatment time, defined as the time period between the first beam-on to the last beam-off, was obtained from the Record & verify System (Lantis).\\nResults: For the 100 patients using traditional wedge, 71 (71%) patients had grade I skin reaction, 5 (5%) patients had grade 2 skin reaction, the averaged global maximum dose was 5,582 cGy, the averaged treatment monitor unit was 495 MU, and the averaged treatment time was approximately 5 minutes.\\nFor the 72 patients using the FIF technique, 25 (35%) patients had grade I skin reaction, none had grade 2 (0%) skin reaction, the averaged global maximum dose was 5,208 cGy, the averaged treatment monitor unit was 257 MU, and the averaged treatment time was approximately 3 minutes.\\nUsing statistical method to analyze these differences, the p-values were all less than 0.001, indicating the difference is statistically significant. Clinical results of the FIF technique have reduced skin reactions.\\nConclusion: The clinical results of breast treatment showed that the FIF method produced less complications in skin reactions compared to the conventional wedge method. Moreover, the FIF technique delivers less global maximum dose, requires less MU and delivery time than the traditional wedge technique. Thus, the FIF technique is a practical and efficient method that is suitable for routine clinical use.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) is a subtype of undifferentiated carcinoma, which is originated from squamous cell. Lymphoepithelial carcinoma is a rare tumor of the major salivary gland, especially in sublingual gland. In moat cases, LEC affected the parotid gland. There are high incidences in Greenlandic Eskimos and Southeastern Asians with strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. To our knowledge, there is no case of LEC in sublingual gland reported in the medical literature.\\nMaterials and Methods: We report the first case of LEC of the sublingual tumor of a 37-year-old Taiwanese man. The initial presentation was a mass over the submental area. PET/CT scan showed there was only a locoregional disease, which was limited in the left mouth floor and submental lymph node. Naopharynx was not involved at the same time. Serological studies showed elevated titer of Epstein-Barr virus: capsid antigen IgG and IgA antibodies. Immunohistochemical stain of LMP-1 also showed the positive result. The patient underwent excision and lymphodectomy followed by definite radiotherapy.\\nResult: Complete remission of LEC of the sublingual gland was achieved by the definite radiotherpy. The patient remained alive without any recurrence or metastasis after 20-month of follow-up.\\nConclusion: LEC of the salivary gland is a radiosensitive disease and has a better prognosis among the undifferentiated carcinoma at the head and neck region. High rates of locoregional control were achieved by radiotherapy. Therefore, radiotherapy is appropriate locoregional therapy for patents in the early stage or after surgical intervention.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the clinical outcome and dosimetry analysis of postoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for esophageal cancer.\\nMaterials and Methods: A total of 30 patients with stage Ⅱ-Ⅳ esophageal cancer were treated with curative surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. All postoperative radiotherapy was planned using an intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment planning system and was administered 4-6 weeks after operation. Seven out of 30 patients received post-radiotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy. Radiation from 6-7 beam angles, which was designed according to specific shape of clinical target volume (CTV), was delivered by a linear accelerator with energy of 6 MV photons. The CTV included the whole esophageal region plus the supraclavicular region for tumors at the upper and middle thoracic portion of the esophagus or celiac region for tumor situated at the lower thoracic portion. A total dose of 50 Gy to 60 Gy was aimed at the PTV over 5 to 6 weeks. Treatment response was evaluated and toxicities were assessed. The organ at risk dose profile was calculated under isocenter dose of 50 Gy.\\nResults: Radiotherapy related acute toxicities were mild. Organs at risk such as lungs, heart, and spinal cord were spared from the prescribed doses. The mean doses for right and left lungs were 13.1 Gy and 13.3 Gy, respectively. The lung volume received doses of 2000 cGy or more (V20) for right and left lung was 19.7% and 19.8%, respectively. The mean dose to heart was 22.4 Gy and only 9.8% of heart tissue received a dosage over 40 Gy (V40). For spinal cord, the maximum dose was 36.5 Gy which is relatively low. An average conformity index (CI) of 0.8 implies high treatment conformity to the target. An average homogeneity index (HI) of 0.94 indicated good dose homogeneity within the target. After a mean follow-up of 14 months, 5 local recurrences were found over anastomotic site in 1 patient, supraclavicular region in 1 patient and subcarina region in 3 patients, the local recurrence rate in 2-year period is 22.4%. The 2-year overall survival rate was 45.1%. Distant metastasis is the most important reason for those who died within 2 year period of follow-up.\\nConclusion: Postoperative IMRT using 6 to 7 beams has good coverage of the target and high dose homogeneity while decreasing doses to normal tissue. Local control was good with an acceptable 2-year survival rate. However, early distant metastasis remains to be a problem. New approaches are needed to improve the clinical outcome.',\n",

We would like to share our experience in a retrospective study of 35 patients in our hospital using a similar regimen.\\nMaterials and Methods: From August 1999 to August 2006, 35 patients received postoperative CRT after curative surgical resection. The adjuvant CRT consisted of 425 mg/m^2 of fluorouracil plus 20 mg/m^2 leucovorin for 5 days, and then one month later followed by 4500 cGy of radiotherapy for 5 weeks with fluorouracil and leucovorin on the first 4 and last 3 days of radiotherapy. Two or more 5-day cycles of fluorouracil and leucovorin were given one month after completion of CRT.\\nResults: During a median follow up of period of 13.2 months, 57% of patients were alive with free of disease. One year and 3 year overall survival were 71% and 56% respectively. The whole treatment course was well tolerated with a few incidences of severe (grade Ⅲ) acute side effects and local-regional relapses occurred in 5.7% of patients and 25.7% had distant relapses. Compared survivals between different subgroups, we found patients with primary signet ring cell histology bear a significantly poorer survival than other histological types. Patients who received 2 or more cycles of chemotherapy after CRT did better in overall survival than patients who did less.\\nConclusion: Our study found chemoradiation safe and beneficial for gastric cancer patients after curative surgical resection.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: This study included irradiated cancer patients to explore multivariate correlation factors and current status among Western (WM) Chinese (CM) and Alternative (AM) medical treatment modalities so that one can understand the magnitude of predictors for receiving alternative treatment. From cultural view points, medical staff should try to investigate motivation of herb and alternative modalities of treatment, enhancing communication & instruction to patients to accept most updated medical knowledge which may yield a synergistic effect to traditional orthodoxic medicine.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between August 1, 2005 and September 30, 2005, 338 cancer patients irradiated at the department of radiation oncology. Chang Gung Memorial Hospital were retrospectively reviewed with respect to patients' data collected from self-structured questionnaire assisted by nursing staff of the dept. All cases came from different area islandwide and should have completed a full course of RT with a minimum follow-up period of three years.\\nResults: Data revealed that the first choice of cancer treatment was WM followed by at least 1 to 2 kind of CM or AM which accounted for 156 (46.1%) patients. Of these, 108 (32%) patients took mainly herb drugs as a major part of treatment by CM. The duration of most alternative treatment was approximately 3 months at an expense of around NT$100000.00. Two hundred and twenty nine (67.8%) cases considered CM or AM having potential for cure of cancer and the information regarding to these type of treatment was mainly from patients' family 194 (57.4%) or relatives 175 (51.8%).\\nConclusion: Different age groups yield no significant correlation to the selection of either CM or WM (p＞0.05); Although different educational backgrounds had no specific impact in the choice of CM (p＞0.05) yet effect significantly in the selection of various types of AM (p＜0.011). Patients with educational background equalled to or above college level may predominantly choose a physiologic type of AM (p＜0.01). One hundred and eighty two (53.8%) cases might refer other cancer patients to receive CM. This correlated significantly (p＜0.0005) to the concept of 273 (80.8%) cases that CM have a high potential to completely or partially cure the cancer patients. In addition, 89 (26.4%) cases showed intention to be treated at Mainland China which correlated significantly (p＜0.0003) to the belief that the therapeutic effect of CM is better in Mainland China than in Taiwan.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study was to evaluate the feasibility of dose conformity and tumor control probability calculated for CyberKnife(superscript ®) hypofractionated planning for prostate cancer.\\nMaterials and Methods: Six patients with early prostate cancer were included in this retrospective study. They received stereotactic hypofractionation radiotherapy by CyberKnife(superscript ®). The dose prescriptions were 37.5 Gy in 5 fractions, 42 Gy in 5 fractions, or 32 Gy in 4 fractions. Dose conformity was calculated with three parameters: the conformity index (CI), the new conformity index (nCI) and the modified conformal index (mCOIN). A statistical analysis of the tumor control probability (TCP) was also calculated.\\nResults: The CI and nCI of the CyberKnife(superscript ®) treatment planning system are all under 1.483. All the calculated TCP values were greater than 98.3%. We added the factors pertaining to the critical organ and obtained the mCOINs. The mCOIN values were listed to compare the quality of treatment plans.\\nConclusion: The conformity index value can be used to evaluate the quality of radiosurgery planning. The mCOIN values are also feasible to compare the plans.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The feasibility of FWT-70-40(M) dosimeter was studied for gamma dose measurement in a neutron and gamma mixed field. Furthermore, it was adopted as another dosimeter to determine the gamma dose in an epithermal neutron beam for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT).\\nMaterial and Methods: The dosimeter used in this article was FWT-70 series of type FWT-70-40 (M). Using the Co-60 source of 29190 curies, which located in the Nuclear Science and Technology Development Center of National Tsing Hua University, performed calibration of the gamma dose sensitivity. The radiation sensitivity and the range of the linear response were obtained by irradiating the dosimeter with various dose rates and different total dose. Besides, this dosimeter was also irradiated with high neutron flux in the reactor core of the Tsing Hua Open pool Reactor (THOR) to investigate the neutron influence and activation. And then it was adopted as another dosimeter to measure the gamma dose in the BNCT facility at THOR.\\nResults: Experimental data show that: (1) the threshold of linear response is 2 Gy, while the up limitation is 7 kGy for average gamma energy of 1.25 MeV; (2) the major product of the neutron activation is Na-24. The accumulated self-exciting dose for Na-24 is only 1.12 mGy during its average life-time for irradiation of total thermal neutron fluence of 3.6E12 nth/cm^2.\\nConclusions: Because of the self-exciting dose reduced from neutron activation can be neglected for gamma dose measurement in neutron and gamma mixed field, and the threshold of linear response is 2 Gy, the FWT-70-40 (M) dosimeter not only can be used for high dose rate Co-60 irradiation field and the high energy electron beam for medical purpose, but also can be used for gamma dose measurement in an epithermal neutron beam for boron neutron capture therapy.',\n",
       " 'The moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (MDNC) are rare tumors in the larynx. Most patients present with hoarseness and dysphagia. Commonly, these tumors have vascular or lymphatic invasion. High mitotic rate, necrosis and nuclear pleomorphism are also frequent. Once patients develop regional or distal metastasis, they usually had high mortality with poor prognosis. Unfortunately, these tumors have high tendency of regional or distal metastases, so MDNC is considered as an aggressive tumor in the larynx. Early diagnosis determines the treatment plan and outcome. Surgical removal is generally advised as the treatment of choice, and radiation therapy may have a benefit in survival.\\nWe present a 59-year-old non-smoking man with MDNC of the left supraglottic larynx, cT1N0M0, stage Ⅰ. The patient received surgical excision (pT1N0M0, stage Ⅰ) and post-operative radiation therapy (6300 cGy/35 frs). There was no evidence of recurrence for 19 months. Neither dysphasia nor hoarseness was complained. Currently, he had regular follow-up in the out-patient department.',\n",

       " 'Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the trachea is a rare disease and primarily treated with surgery. Here we report a 40 years-old male patient with ACC of the trachea. He was initially treated with surgery, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (delivered with a total dose of 64.8 Gy in 36 fractions concurrently with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m^2) and adjuvant chemotherapy (monthly 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin). However, local recurrence and lung metastasis developed within a short period. After pulmonary metastatectomy, salvage chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin for 3 cycles were given but the disease kept progressing. Intriguingly, metronomic chemotherapy with oral etoposide and cyclophosphamide showed a good tumor response with minimal adverse effect. We reported that metronomic chemotherapy might be an option for the metastatic ACC of the trachea refractory to radiation and chemotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This retrospective study is to investigate the treatment results and prognostic factors of oropharyngeal carcinoma.\\nMaterials and Methods: From March 1995 to September 2005, 110 patients diagnosed as oropharyngeal cancer received treatments in our institution. One hundred and five patients were male (95.5%) and 5 patients were female (4.5%). The median age of diagnosis was 52 year-old (range, 30-77 years). Eighty-seven patients (79.1%) were diagnosed as tonsillar carcinoma, and 23 patients (20.9%) were diagnosed as carcinoma of other oropharyngeal subsites. Histopathologically, well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated and poorly- differentiated carcinoma were 10%, 62.8%, and 27.2%, respectively. Staging classification were 8.2%, 7.3%, 69.1% and 15.5% for stage Ⅱ, Ⅲ, IVa, and IVb, respectively. Forty-nine patients were treated with resection of primary tumor with or without neck dissection. Thirty-two of all 110 patients (29.0%) received surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, 17 patients (15.5%) received surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Seventeen patients (15.5%) were treated with radiotherapy alone, and 44 patients (40.0%) were treated with definitive radiotherapy plus chemotherapy.\\nResults: The follow-up period ranged from 2.4 to 130.2 months (median, 17 months). During the follow-up period, 39 patients (35.5%) were alive and 71 patients (64.5%) died. Five-year overall survival rate, disease-free survival rate, and loco-regional control rate of oropharyngeal cancer were 28.4%, 28.8%, and 58.4%, respectively. Five-year overall survival rate for the group of RT alone, definitive RT+C/T, OP+ adjuvant RT and OP+ adjuvant CCRT were 24.8%, 14.1%, 36.9%, and 45.8%, respectively. Gender, tumor site, histopathology and surgery significantly predicted survival in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, surgery was the only significant predictor for overall and disease-free survival, while tumor site and surgery were the significant predictors for loco-regional control.\\nConclusion: Surgery was significantly predicted for loco-regional control and overall survival in this retrospective study. However, improving radiotherapy technique and addition of chemotherapy have changed the practice of oropharyngeal cancer in recent years with organ preservation without compromising the treatment results.',\n",
       " 'Background and purpose: To determine whether or not intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) offers a better treatment plan compared with conventional parallel opposed tangential radiation therapy for the left-sided breast cancer patients.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between January 2005 and December 2006, we treated 70 patients who had Tis-2N0M0 left-sided breast cancers and underwent breast conservation surgery with or without chemotherapy. Both IMRT and conventional radiotherapy were planned for every patient. After comparing the radiation dose and volume to the heart and lung, and other dosimetric parameters, we then decided which technique to use for individual patient. Conventional radiotherapy was used for 2 patients and IMRT for 68 patients.\\nResults: The mean conformity indexes are 1.47 and 1.08 for conventional radiotherapy and IMRT, respectively (p＜0.05). Radiation dose to the heart, ipsilateral lung, and contralateral lung all can be reduced by 38.7%, 22.9% and 60.9%, respectively, with IMRT. Acute side effects were acceptable. The dose heterogeneity of conventional radiotherapy is greater than IMRT with a large area of cold and hot spots.\\nConclusions: For the left-sided breast, IMRT can reduce the irradiation dose to the heart and both lungs. It also offers better conformity index and dose homogeneity. However, IMRT delivers very low dose radiation to a larger volume of normal surrounding tissues.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study is to find out whether maximal lymph node size determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates with prognosis better than that determined by clinical palpation for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and bulky cervical lymph node metastasis.\\nMaterial and Methods: All eligible NPC patients should have cervical lymph node size 6 cm or greater by clinical palpation and use MRI as primary imaging modality. Patients with N3b and distant metastases were excluded from this study. From 1992 to 2005, a total of 47 patients were included. Their MRI nodal stage was determined at weekly multidisciplinary team conference with a consensus. Patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy according to hospital guideline. We compared the survival and failure patterns of MRI N1-2 and MRI N3a patients.\\nResults: Twenty-two patients were assigned MRI N3a and 25 MRI N1 or N2. With a median follow up of 64 months, the 5-year disease-free survival rate for MRI N3a group (53%) was lower than MRI N1-2 group (65%) but not statistically significant (p=0.56). The 5-year overall survival and metastasis-free survival of MRI N3a vs MRI N1-2 patients were 78% vs. 77% (p= 0.5) and 70% vs. 65% (p= 0.9), respectively. The failure pattern was similar.\\nConclusion: NPC patients with clinical bulky cervical lymph node metastasis have relatively poor survival regardless of MRI N-stage. We recommend that if cervical lymph nodes are confluent together, their sizes determined by MRI should not be measured separately. These patients are best to be staged as N3a disease.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical outcomes and complications of intraarterial chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy (IACCRT) for locally advanced oral cancers.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between September, 2001 and July, 2006, 30 patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (stage Ⅳ: 22 patients and stage Ⅲ: 8 patients) received concurrent intraarterial chemo-radiotherapy in our department. The age ranged from 32 year-old to 63 year-old (median, 45 year-old). Each patient received a single bolus of 50 mg of methotrexate intraarterially every week while undergoing irradiation. The median irradiation dose was 64 Gy with 1.8-2.0 Gy daily fractions. The median follow-up period was 20 months (range, 6-52 months).\\nResults: The response rate was evaluated by clinical examination and imaging study after IACCRT and the results were as follows: complete response, 53% (16/30); partial response, 23% (7/30); no response, 17% (5/30); progression, 7% (2/30). The major toxicities included grade 3 mucositis (10/30, 33.3%), grade 3 dysphagia (8/30, 26.6%), and grade 3 leukopenia (1/30, 3%). The estimated 1-year survival rate was 60.4%. Patients with complete or partial response were associated with better overall survival by Kaplan Meier survival analysis (log-rank test, p=0.05).\\nConclusion: Our preliminary data suggests IACCRT for locally advanced oral cancers is feasible. We have inferred a conclusion from the facts that tongue and gingival cancers have better response to IACCRT than buccal cancer does. Nevertheless, the result was not statistically significant. Further larger prospective study with detailed case selection is necessary.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Encouraging results shown in recent literatures have demonstrated that low dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy exhibits antiangiogenic property with relatively safe profile. LDM cyclophosphamide has been studied in numerous pre-clinical studies and administrated to cancer patients with some beneficial effect on tumor stabilization. Given that several lines of evidence suggesting a potential synergistic or additive effect of antiangiogenic therapy and radiation, we examined whether the addition of LDM chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide could enhance the response of subcutaneously inoculated melanoma, B16F10, to radiation in a syngenic murine model.\\nMaterials and Methods: One day after subcutaneous B16F10 inoculation on the flanks, c57/BL6 mice were given cyclophosphamide at 0, 6, or 20 mg/kg/day through drinking water on a daily basis throughout the whole course of experiment. On 16th day after tumor inoculation, tumors bearing mice, which were given 0 or 6 mg/kg/day were either irradiated with 8 Gy or left untreated. The tumor growths were measured two times per week for evaluation of the effects of various doses of LDM cyclophosphamide alone, radiation alone, or combination of both.\\nResults: LDM cyclophosphamide treatment significantly suppressed subcutaneous melanoma growth in a syngenic tumor model without discernible toxicity. Efficacy of LDM cyclophosphamide was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner. A single fraction of 8 Gy radiation significantly delayed the growth of melanoma and the effect was further enhanced by concomitant administration of LDM cyclophosphamide with an enhancement factor of 2.4.\\nConclusion: The clinical benefit of LDM cyclophosphamide may be further tested in clinical trials. It is also of great interests to further evaluate molecular mechanism of radiation and LDM cyclophosphamide combination regarding the dosing schedule and sequence.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this experiment is to compare the lung dose between fixed-angle IMRT technique and Tomotherapy. We also explore the possibility to lower the lung dose with Tomotherapy.\\nMaterial and Method: Eight patients were selected for this study. Five of them only have one primary tumor. The others have one primary tumor with two or three lymph node metastasis. All of them were both planned by fixed gantry angle IMRT technique and Tomotherapy technique. The dose distributions and the mean dose to ipsilateral, contralateral and both normal lungs were evaluated and compared between two plans. For completeness, we also evaluate the lung mean dose for a sternum metastasis patient, a multiple lung metastasis patient and a breast cancer patient between fixed-angle IMRT technique and Tomotherapy technique.\\nResult: By comparing the isodose plan of eight patients, Tomotherapy group has lowered mean dose to both normal lung (4.0% lower in average, median: -2.5%, range: -0.2%~-7.2%, p=0.006) and to ipsilateral normal lung (7.7% lower in average, median: -7.6%, range: -17.8%~-1.0%, p=0.003). But for the contralateral normal lung, Tomotherapy technique doesn’t show the statistically significant superiority than fixed-angle IMRT technique (median: -3.1%, range: -22.3%~+63.2%, p=0.20). For patients with multiple lung metastasis, with sternum metastases and with breast cancer, Tomotherpy can reduce the mean dose for whole normal lung by 27.3%, 3.6% and 10.2% respectively.\\nConclusion and Discussion: With carefully planning, the Tomotherapy plan could have the same or lower mean dose of ipsilateral and both normal lungs than fixed-angle IMRT. Tomotherapy may have potential to reduce more mean dose to lung than fixed-angle IMRT. We need further investigation to verify this potential.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: IMRT treatment planning generally includes two parts: initial comprehensive IMRT (C-IMRT) plan to cover the CTV and risky nodal regions and the Cone Down (CD) IMRT plan for gross tumor boost. We try to evaluate the impact of the 2 CD constrain sets, dependent and independent constrain sets in relation to the initial plan on the final composite isodose distribution.\\nMaterials and Methods: A total of six IMRT plans with head and neck cancer were performed with the Philip Pinnacle3 Planning System. Two different constrain sets of CD IMRT plan had been done with the same C-IMRT plan for each patient. Isodose distributions, dose-volume histograms (DVHs), and the various dosimetric parameters were generated and calculated for each plans. Comparison was made to evaluate the differences of DVHs and composite isodose distributions of 2 CD constrain sets both superimposed on the initial C-IMRT planning. We also compared the monitor unit (MU) in two CD constrain sets plans.\\nResult: Our finding showed that the initial IMRT plan has a great impact on CD IMRT plan. Dependent constrain sets in CD IMRT plan could be negatively influenced by the initial IMRT plan with unacceptable surplus of MUs due to the non-uniform intensity map summarization. The independent constrain sets may not generate an acceptable composite dose distribution since summation of the two acceptable individual intensity maps may not create an optimum composite intensity to meet the final dose criteria. However, taken all consideration together, the independent constrain sets could be adequate for CD IMRT plan.\\nConclusion and Discussion: According to the aforementioned planning comparisons, it is perfered to implement the CD IMRT plan without summating the initial IMRT plan. CD IMRT paln with independent constrain sets was prefered over dependent constrain sets because of consistent minimum tumor coverage in the cone down phase, similar tumor coverage, equal critial organ sparing and bioradiological evaluation. The dose constrains defined in the initial IMRT plan has a great effect on the critical organ dose. Analysis of the composite IMRT plan is indispensable.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Endobronchial brachytherapy (EBBT) is a useful modality for the palliation of symptoms caused by endobronchial tumor or compression from peribronchial tumor. We report our experience of treating lung cancer patients with Iridium-192 high-dose-rate (HDR) endobronchial brachytherapy (EBBT).\\nMaterials and Methods: From 2000 to 2006, 50 patients of advanced lung cancer received HDR-EBBT in our radiation oncology department. These patients were treated with Varians VS200 and treatment plans are based on Cadplan BT. The physicians from Medical Chest selected the patients whom are appropriate for the treatment and responsible for the insertion of endobronchial tube for EBBT. Most patients received 2 to 3 fractions of EBBT in 1-2 weeks. The dose of each fraction ranged from 300 cGy to 1000 cGy. The response of symptomatic relief was assessed with endoscope, radiography and the subjective sensation of these patients.\\nResults: Relief of endobronchial tumor-related symptoms and external compression from peribronchial tumor was noted in 35 of 50 patients (70%) treated with EBBT. No grade III-IV complication was observed.\\nConclusion: HDR-EBBT is an effective and safe palliative tool in locally advanced lung cancer, with a relatively long duration of symptom palliation and a considerable improvement in the quality of life. There is also significant reduction of endobronchial obstruction.',\n",
       " 'There is no report up to date about treating disseminated brain metastases using whole brain radiotherapy followed by individual tumor boost. Technical difficulty, expected dismal prognosis, and lack of supporting evidences are possible reasons contributing to the lack of attention paid to this matter. This report may be a first on an aggressive brain radiation for symptomatic disseminated brain metastases, more than 40 tumor foci, using tomotherapy. The patient in question is a 44 year-old lady with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Symptomatic disseminated brain metastases concurrent with progression of intrapulmonary disease developed after months of remission achieved by primary chemotherapy. Because of her relative young age and good performance status, an aggressive brain radiation was performed in a hope to deliver a better intracranial control during the period of ensuing salvage chemotherapy. A whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of 30 Gy in 15 fractions was delivered first and achieved a good palliative effect of ameliorating her brain edema and reducing the tumor sizes. A sequential tumor boost to all observable tumor foci was delivered three weeks after WBRT to a total dose of 56 Gy for two large masses or 50 Gy for other small masses, respectively, without incurring significant toxicity. The treatment to the patient is quite successful, taking into consideration of its good palliative effects as well as low toxicity. The physic profile showed that tomotherapy is good at delivering a highly conformal therapy to targets while avoiding critical structures, e.g. eyes.',\n",

Twenty-two of them were eligible for this study, because 13 patients were proven to have EBV infection in their nasopharynx or neck lymph nodes. Fourteen (64%) received surgery and postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (7 patients) or radiotherapy alone (7 patients). Others who did not receive surgery were treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (3 patients), radiotherapy (3 patients), or induction chemotherapy with radiotherapy (2 patients). Total prescription dose ranged from 6000 cGy to 7280 cGy with a median of 6750 cGy to Waldeyer's ring and involved neck.\\nResults: The median follow-up duration was 8 years (ranged from 5 to 14 years). Nine (41%) patients were alive, and 13 (59%) patients died. Nine (41%) patients had neck recurrence, including four patients with uncontrolled neck mass enlargement. Only 2 patients developed distant metastases. The 3-year, 5-year, and 8-year overall survival were 50%, 50%, and 42%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival for N1, N2, and N3 patients were 100%, 44%, and 33% (P value=0.019), respectively. In multivariant analysis, only both upper and lower neck involvement was a significant predictor for overall survival. The 3-year and 5-year regional control rates were 60% and 53%, respectively. For N1, N2, and N3 diseases, the 5-year regional control rates were 100%, 67%, and 17% (P value=0.034), respectively. In multivariant analysis, only both upper and lower neck involvement reached statistical significance for regional control. If patients initially were treated with neck node dissection, 5-year overall survival and regional control rate were 64% and 67%, respectively. If surgery was not performed initially, 5-year overall survival and regional control rate were 25% and 31%, respectively. Although all statistics did not reach significance, we still found a trend that favor surgery initially group. Better results were also noted in N3 patients.\\nConclusion: The treatment for neck nodal control of unknown primary head and neck cancer without EBV infection is challenging. In our present study, this group of patients had poor neck control if neck dissection was not performed initially or both upper and lower neck involvement. Neck dissection is suggested for patients with unknown primary head and neck cancer, especially those without EBV infection.\",\n",

From October 1984 to August 2002, 38 eligible patients were obtained from our Cancer Registration Database. We reviewed hospital charts, radiotherapy records and diagnostic imaging studies thoroughly. Tumor staging was defined according to the Masaoka staging system. Baseline characteristics of patients were median age 47 (range 22-83), male/female=26/12, stage Ⅰ/Ⅱ/Ⅲ/Ⅳ=4/15/15/4. The radiotherapy was delivered by a wedge-pair or 3-D conformal-beam technique with a median dose of 50 Gy (range 40-68 Gy) by conventional fractionation. The end points were overall survival (OS), locoregional disease-free survival (LDFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) by the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nResults: After a median follow-up of 11 years, 13 of 38 patients had tumor relapse (2 locoregional recurrence, 7 distant metastasis, and 4 locoregional plus distant failure). The 5-year and 10-year of OS, LDFS, and MFS for all patients were 75.5% and 51.2%, 82.1% and 82.1%, and 83.5% and 56.7%, respectively. On univariate analysis, stages and the extent of surgical resection were the most important prognostic factors. Age, gender, radiation dose, and association of myasthenia gravis did not affect the survival significantly. The 10-year OS (24.1% vs. 89.5%, P=0.0010), LDFS (59.9% vs. 100%, P=0.0031), and MFS (29.6% vs. 82.9%, P=0.0084) were significantly lower in patients with advanced-stage (Ⅲ+Ⅳ) than in those with early-stage (Ⅰ+Ⅱ). Patients with total resection had better 10-year OS (60.6% vs. 11.3%, P=0.0083), LDFS (86.4% vs. 53.3%, P=0.1101), and MFS (66.4% vs. 0%, P=0.0002) than those with subtotal resection. The multivariate analysis revealed that stage was the only significant prognostic factor.\\nConclusion: Stages and the extent of surgical resection are the most important prognostic factors. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has good tumor control for earlystage disease but is inadequate for advanced-stage disease. Chemotherapy should be considered for advanced-stage patients in future trials.',\n",

Fifty-three patients (76%) were male, and 17 (24%) were female. The median age of initial diagnosis as NPC was 50 years (ranged from 17 to 87 years). Five patients (7%) were WHO type Ⅰ nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 30 (43%) were type Ⅱ, and 35 (50%) were type Ⅲ. According to AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) 2002 TNM staging system, 2 patients (3%) were T1, 11 (15%) were T2 (4 were T2a, 7 were T2b), 18 (26%) were T3, and 39 (56%) were T4. Four patients (6%) were N0, 9 (13%) were N1, 10 (14%) were N2, and 47 (67%) were N3 (32 were N3a, 15 were N3b). Sixteen patients (23%) were initially M0, and 54 (77%) were initially M1. Forty-six of all 70 patients (66%) received radiotherapy/concurrent chemoradiotherapy to the primary sites of nasopharynx and neck lymph nodes. The median cumulative irradiation dose was 7380 cGy.

There were 7, 3 and 3 patients belonged to head and neck cancer, thoracic and pelvis cancer, respectively. These three subgroups were analyzed separately. The interfraction setup errors were evaluated by comparing daily series MVCT with initial simulation KVCT three dimensionally. Both automatic and manual methods were used for determination of these errors.\\nResults: For 208 daily MVCT check-up for head and neck tumor, average shift was 0.3±2.3 mm for lateral direction (x), 0.0±2.6 mm for longitudinal direction (y), 2.3±1.8 mm for vertical direction (z), and 0.6±0.9 degree for longitudinal axis (roll) rotation. For 80 daily MVCT check-up for thoracic tumor, average shift was -0.4±2.4 mm for x direction, -2.6±2.9 mm for y-direction, 2.5±3.9 mm for z-direction, and 0.4±0.5 degree for roll axis rotation. For 76 daily MVCT check-up for pelvic tumor, average shift was 0.3±3.9 mm for x direction, -2.4±4.8 mm for y-direction, 8.3±4.3 mm for z-direction, and 0.4±0.3 degree for roll axis rotation.

       " 'Purpose: To report the experience of postoperative radiation therapy (RT) for keloid at a teaching hospital.\\nMaterial and Methods: We recruited patients with keloid or hypertrophic scar lesions who received excision and postoperative RT from 1999 to 2003 at a teaching hospital. We use 6 MeV electron beam covered with 0.5-1 cm Superflap as bolus to enhance skin dose, and the electron beam margin was designed as 0.5 to 1 cm from re-operative suture line area. All of them were treated with 15 Gy of RT in five fractions in consecutive days, except one who had problems in scheduling the last treatment and received 12 Gy in four fractions. We summarized information on their outcomes and evaluated the possible prognostic factors.\\nResults: A total of nine patients were observed during the study period, including one man and eight women. Five of them were satisfied with their outcomes, two had fair outcome, and two felt disappointed. Of the two disappointed patients, one had a gross keloid, and the other had an elapsed time of 17 days between excision and radiation. One of the patients with satisfactory outcome, however, had an elapsed time of 6 days. All the other six patients who had satisfactory or fair outcomes started RT within 2 days after surgery. Eight patients received 15 Gy in five fractions, and one received 12 Gy in four fractions. No second malignancy was observed during the study period. Among all variables evaluated, ugly as the initial symptom was the only significant factor associated with satisfaction, but none was associated with the outcome.\\nConclusion: The dose-fractions between 12 and 15 Gy in four or five fractions are feasible in postoperative RT for keloid or hypertrophic scar. Starting the RT within 2 to 3 days should be suggested after excision. Unsatisfactory response is still possible under this timing and dose-fractions, especially for gross lesions.',\n",
       " 'The presence of cirrhosis-related esophageal varices combined with pre-existed esophageal cancer is rarely documented. Most studies concerned about the possibility that endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) induces a secondary esophageal cancer. Whether radiotherapy complicates varices bleeding or rupture is seldom mentioned. We present a case of early esophageal cancer accidentally found by panendoscope (PES) for upper gastrointestinal bleeding survey. The tumor was adjacent to one of the esophageal varices. According to the case reports we summarized, varices and the esophageal cancer can be managed separately. Varices can be treated by ligation, sclerotherapy, or photodynamic therapy (PDT). The early esophageal cancer can be treated by PDT, endoscopic resection, radiotherapy, or esophagectomy. In this case, varices ligation was performed prior to radiotherapy. The treatment course finished smoothly. He had kept regular follow-up at our OPD',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This retrospective study is to report the results of breast-conserving treatment and analyze the prognostic factors of local-regional recurrence (LRR) of early breast cancer in a single institute.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between 1990 and 2002, 374 women of non-metastatic invasive breast cancer received breast-conserving surgery followed by post-operative radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy at the Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center. Of the 374 patients, 285 (76%) had pathologic Ti disease and 89 (24%) T2 disease. Eighty-seven (23%) patients were found to have pathologic involvement of axillary lymph nodes. Two hundred and eighty-one patients (75%) have received adjuvant chemotherapy. The median dose of RT was 46 Gy in 23 fractions to the breast with/without supraclavicular area and internal mammary chain followed by tumor bed boost of 16 Gy. The medical records including pathologic reports were reviewed for analysis of tumor recurrence.\\nResults: There were 16 local and/or regional recurrences (11 LRR only; 5 LRR with distant metastasis) after a median follow-up of 4.2 years. The 5-year disease-free, LRR-free and overall survivals were 87.9%, 95% and 94.1% respectively. The risk factors of LRR include age equal to or less than 40 years old, multifocal or multicentric disease, and positive or close surgical margin. All 10 patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence only were still alive without disease after salvage simple mastectomy (range, 9~134 months; median 60 months).\\nConclusion: Breast-conserving surgery followed by RT provided excellent local-regional control for early breast cancer. Patients with risk factors of young age, close/positive margin, and multifocal/multicentric disease need to be followed closely.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the gastrointestinal and hematological toxicity of locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma treated mainly with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).\\nMaterials and Methods: A total of 9 locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma were treated with IMRT between June 2001 and December 2005. Five received concurrent chemotherapy. One patient received Whipple surgery before local irradiation, and one received chemotherapy prior to local irradiation. One presented with distant bone metastasis prior to radiation therapy. Eight out of nine patients had unresect-able primary and one had recurrent tumor. Four out of nine underwent treatment planning with conventional three-dimensional radiotherapy boost plus IMRT while others received solely IMRT.\\nResults: The 2-year expected overall survival was 33.3%. The local regional control rate was 53%. One out of 9 patients achieved complete response, 5 achieved partial response and 3 remained progressive disease. One out of 9 patients developed Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity. Three developed Grade 3 hematological toxicity, all with concurrent gemcitabine. No nasal-gastric tube support was needed among all patients. Interruption of treatment was noted within 4 patients with a median of 14.5 days.\\nConclusion: In our study, the observed gastrointestinal and hematological toxicity rate was relatively low.

       " \"Purpose: We present a quality assurance (QA) schedule for the Hi-Art Helical Tomo-Therapy unit and share our QA practical experience with this state-of-the-art machine. According to the Ionizing Radiation Protection Act (Article. 17, item 3), the regulation of medical exposure QA in Taiwan has to include daily, monthly, and annual items in the schedule for every treatment machine in a radiation oncology department. The Hi-Art Helical Tomo-Therapy unit was developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2003. We installed a new system at Yuan's General Hospital to take the lead in South- Taiwan in April 2006. In this study, we present the QA schedule that is performed in our department, which follows the principles of AAPM TG-40 but contains some novel components, reflecting the differences between the Hi-Art device and conventional linear accelerators.\\nMaterials and Methods: We compared the efficiency of the daily, monthly, and annual QA programs in our department with Hi-Art Helical Tomo-Therapy unit and an Elekta-Precise linear accelerator with a standard QA schedule. We followed the principles of AAPM TG-40. For tomotherapy, the QA program included a series of measurements that were recorded in a specially fabricated, cylindrically symmetric Virtual Water phantom. This was designed specifically for commissioning the Helical Tomo-Therapy unit and QA. The phantom is 30cm in diameter, 18cm long, and is divided into two halves, such that film may be placed between them.\\nTo perform the measurements of the dosimetry parameters and correction factors, three EXRADIN-A1SL ion chambers and a Standard Imaging-TomoEletrometer were used for the Helical Tomo-Therapy unit, and a 0.6CC PTW TM30013 Farmer chamber with PTW T0008 Eletrometer was used for the Elekta-Precise linear accelerator. For the beam quality measurements, the dedicated TomoTherapy electrometer measurement system (TEMS) along with a two-dimensional radiation beam analyzer (TomoScanner) and a PTW-Freiburg MP3-S therapy beam analyzer water phantom system were performed the scanning for the beam symmetrical profiles assessment for the corresponding machine respectively.\\nResults: The lengths of time required for daily QA program was almost the same for the two machines. However, the monthly and annual programs were more efficient for the Hi-Art Helical TomoTherapy, saving 2 hours and 10 hours compared to the Elekta-Precise linear accelerator, respectively. The statistical data collected over the past 10 months show that the time spent for the TomoTherapy was less, and the tolerance value was lower than that of the Elekta-Precise linear accelerator; the output error of daily QA was within ±1% for 75% of the data, within ±2% for 18.75% of the data, and within +3% for the remaining 6.25% of the data, and the dose output error value for the monthly QA was less than ±1%.\\nConclusions： The following conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, the time needed for the QA schedule for the Hi-Art Helical TomoTherapy is less than that required for routine work with a linear accelerator. Due to the TomoTherapy machine intrinsic characteristics, some mechanical items, such as the gantry, the couch angle, the collimator etc., do not need to be checked. Additionally, no electron beam verification is needed but the same beam effect can be formed from the different beamlets of the machine. Nonetheless, Helical TomoTherapy has a relatively short clinical track record and, as further operational experience is gained, it may be found that some QA items will need to be modified and some additional tests may need to be developed for completeness of the QA schedule.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image-based distributions of cervical nodal metastases of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and to define a clinical target volume (CTV) extent according to different stage of NPC.\\nMaterials and Methods: We collected 131 patients with NPC who received radiotherapy at the Radiation Oncology Department of KMUH from January, 2004 to February, 2006. Seventeen patients were excluded due to no proper image data and 114 patients were enrolled in our study. These patients had a pretreatment evaluation by contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from base of skull to clavicle. The nodal distributions were assessed by diagnostic radiologists and radiation oncologist according to the image-based classification.\\nResults: Eighty-two patients (71.9%) had cervical lymphadenopathy (LAP) and thirty- two patients (28.1%) had no lymph node metastasis at the initial presentation. A total of 36.8% of patients had bilateral neck nodal metastases. In the patients with LAP, 51.2% of patients had bilateral neck lymph node involvement. The distributions of clinical metastatic lymph nodes per level in patients with cervical lymph node metastases were as follows: level IA: 0; level IB: 15.9%; level IIA: 50.0%; level IIB: 89.0%; level III: 31.7%; level 1V: 8.5%; level VA: 30.5%; and level VB: 7.3%.\\nConclusion: In Taiwan, patients with NPC have a high probability of cervical nodal metastases especially in level IIA, IIB, III, and VA. In this study, the metastaic rates of lower neck lymph nodes (level IV and VB) were relatively low. When we design the treatment plan of radiotherapy for NPC, we may consider reducing the field size of lower neck and even omitting the supraclavicular fossa (SCF) irradiation in patients with early stage of NPC. Further clinical prospective studies also need to improve the treatment strategy of NPC.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Intra-tumoral (i.t.) injection of dendritic cells (DC) has been demonstrated to be able to evoke the systemic immunological response. Nevertheless, the injected DC are prone to be apoptotic in tumor site. Local secreted IL-2 and GM-CSF help the maturation and functioning of injected DC.\\nExperimental Design: We developed a method of creating an immunological favorable microenvironment by in situ electroporation of IL-2 and GM-CSF genes followed by injection of DC at tumor site. Necrotic and apoptotic cells from electrical shock may provide antigen source for DC to promote cross-priming of cytotoxic T cells and activate NK cells. PSA/CT-26 cells was used in this study.\\nResults: 4 repeated cycles of double gene EGT plus i.t. DC significantly inhibited the tumor growth and produced systemic immunity. The combination of double gene EGT and DC treatment induced heavy T cell infiltration inside tumor. Mice successfully treated by the combination of immunotherapy & radiotherapy can induce a systemic immunity to prevent the contralateral tumor challenge. Interestingly, the immunological favorable micro-environment established in the tumor site by this protocol created a highly effective condition for subsequent radiotherapy.\\nConclusions: Our findings may have clinical implications in achieving better local control and prevention of systemic relapse through the combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy. Further study for the mechanism is warranted.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Dosimetry accuracy in surface and build-up region is inadequate for commercialized treatment planning systems. This uncertainty is more significant for IMRT with inverse treatment planning procedure and may cause a severe skin reaction for head and neck cancer. In this study, various target contouring methods for IMRT planning are used to analyze the dosimetry effects in buildup region.\\nMaterials and Methods: 6-MV photon beams generated by Varian 21EX and Varian Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS) are used in this study. A 16cm diameter ball phantom was used for superficial dose measurements. Three different planning target volume (PTV) shrinkage methods (0, 3, 5 mm) were designed for IMRT planning. Plan optimizations are performed with same dose constraint condition. Dose calculations are performed with 2.5 mm grid size and with inhomogeneity correction methods (Equivalent TAR, Batho Power Law and Modified Batho). Extra thin TLDs (0.1 mm) are used for surface and superficial dose measurements. TPS calculated doses in different conditions are compared with the measurement data. A guidance may be established in this issue to assess the method of IMRT target contouring and the estimation of superficial dose from TPS.\\nResults: A significant high intensity distribution at superficial area was shown for PTV margin extend to body surface and shrink 0mm. The highest variations between measurements and calculations (+40% to -24%) also existed in this condition and at body surface. Most of the TPS calculation data are under estimated except for points at 80° and 280° on body surface are over estimated. The under estimation is more significant for ETAR. The variation is reduced for deeper position. At 6mm depth, the variation is within 5% for BPL and MB methods.\\nConclusions: The variations are more significant at shallow position. When tumor invasion is close to body surface, a bolus of proper thickness is the method to increase the superficial dose and to have a correct calculation dose. On the other, if superficial area is not a risk area, proper PTV margin shrinkage will be necessary to avoid the skin reaction.',\n",
       " 'Objective: The sensitivity response of radiochromic dye film (RDF) dosimeter with high energy electron beams was studied in this paper. The feasibility of RDF as a dosimeter for measuring the electron beams of a medical accelerator was studied.\\nMaterials and Methods: Type FWT-70 series were used as the RDF dosimeter, and the electron beams with 6-20 MeV were from a medical linear accelerator. Various types of RDF dosimeter were placed at the maximum dose position in a solid water phantom, that exposed by various electron beam conditions with different energies, doses, and dose rates.\\nResults: In the two different RDF dosimeters of the FWT-70 series: (1) the sensitivity and threshold dose of type FWT-70-40 (M) are 0.0099 OD/Gy and 8 Gy respectively and that of FWT-70-83 (M) RDF are 0.0015 OD/Gy and 20 Gy respectively. (2) FWT-70-40 (M) RDF has higher sensitivity of electron beam energy than Type FWT-70-83 (M). (3) the dose rate dependence of Types FWT-70-40 (M) and FWT-70-83 (M) RDF dosimeters are about 200% and 60%.\\nConclusion: In conventional RDF dosimeters of Type FWT-70 series was using for measuring high dose in a gamma radiation field from 60Co. In this paper, we show that it also can be applied in the electron radiation field with high energy, dose and dose rate. However, the type of dosimeter should be well selected and calibrated according to the sensitivity dependence on electron beam energy and dose rate.',\n",
       " 'Small bowel or mesenteric lymph node metastases from esophageal squamous cell carcinomas are rare. When it happens, most reported cases present as intestinal obstruction. The patient we report here suffered from intestinal tumor bleeding associated with metastasis from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to the jejunum. This, to our knowledge, would be the first case ever reported.\\nOur patient was a 54-year old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, who had suffered from tarry stool. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a mass occupying the jejunal cavity. The CT-guided biopsy proved that the mass was metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, which had originated from his esophageal cancer. Tumor bleeding came under control after 1500 cGy of radiation.

The primary end point of this study was IBTR. Local control rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. Variables including tumor size, nuclear grade, margin status, necrosis, mitosis, multifocal disease, ER/PR status, patient's age, microcalcification, re-excision, contralateral invasive carcinoma, and Van Nuys prognostic index (VNPI) were enrolled for analysis\\nResult: With a median follow-up interval of 5.94 years, IBTR developed in 6 patients (12.5%), with 3 invasive carcinomas, and 3 DCIS. Necrosis was the only significant prognostic factor for IBTR (p= 0.0249) by Fisher's exact test. Nuclear grade, VNPI ≥ 6, and mitosis were marginal significant (p= 0.0586, p= 0.0718, and p= 0.0684, respectively). Multivariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors.\\nConclusion: Necrosis is a significant risk factor for IBRT in patients with DCIS undergoing wide excision alone.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To assess the treatment outcomes of primary central nervous lymphoma (PCNSL) treated with different radiotherapy (RT) fractionation strategies (conventional fractionation vs. altered fractionated radiotherapy) with or without systemic chemotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between January 1990 and December 2004, 44 patients with PCNSL (pathological or clinical) treated with curative radiotherapy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were reviewed. There were 29 males and 15 females, with a median age of 64 (range, 21-80). Patients were retrospectively classified into 4 groups: 1) conventional fractionated radiotherapy alone (n=15); 2) combined conventional fractionated radiotherapy with chemotherapy (n=5); 3) altered fractionated radiotherapy (1.2-1.5 Gy per fraction, twice daily) alone (n=17); and 4) altered fractionated radiotherapy with chemotherapy (n=7). All chemotherapy, mostly (n=10) methotrexate (MTX) based regimens, were given before radiotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and subgroups were compared with log-rank test.\\nResults: The median follow-up duration was 24.3 months (range, 2.7-83.1 months). Of the evaluable 39 patients, 32 patients (82%) obtained complete response and 5 patients (13%) had partial response. The median PFS was 18.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10-27) with estimated 1-, 2- and 5-year PFS of 61%, 40% and 10%, respectively. The median OS was 25.8 months (95% CI, 16-36) with estimated 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rate of 75%, 54% and 15%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the OS and PFS between groups using conventional RT and altered fractionated RT regardless of chemotherapy (p=0.28 and 0.14, respectively). Age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and administration of chemotherapy were important prognostic factors in univariate analysis, but only age at diagnosis remained significant in multivariate model. Median survival was 35.9 months in patients younger than 64 and only 18.9 months in those aged 64 or older (p= 0.011). Patients with KPS ≥70 had a median survival of 32.2 months, which was longer than 13.1 months of patients with KPS ＜ 70 (p= 0.016).\\nConclusions: Altered fractionated radiotherapy is not beneficial in improving survivals of PCNSL. Age and performance status are most important prognostic predictors in PCNSL and should be taken into account in the selection of treatment modalities.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the treatment outcome following three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for NK/T-cell lymphoma of nasal cavity.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between August 2000 and March 2005, 11 patients had NK/T-cell lymphomas of nasal cavity diagnosed by histopathologic characteristics and typical immunophenotype. There were 5 males and 6 females, patients with age ranged from 27 years to 90 years (median, 57 years). Five patients were scheduled to receive 4-6 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincrinstine and prednisolone) followed by radiotherapy. Three patients received 3 cycles of neo-adjuvant CHOP, radiotherapy, and 3 cycles of CHOP adjuvant. We excluded two patients who were dead during our radiotherapy course. All patients received 3D-CRT. The planned 3D-CRT dose was 50.4-54.0 Gy / 28-30 fractions.\\nResults: The median time of follow-up was 24.9 months (range 4 to 75 months). Seven (78%) of nine patients achieved complete remission (CR). The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 79%. Two patients expired in the first year. The 2-year local control and distant metastasis-free rates were 89% and 79%, respectively. The clinical factors predicting worse survival in univariate analysis were as follows: advanced Ann Arbor stage (p=0.005), B symptom (p=0.005), and higher International Prognostic Index scores (p=0.005). In the stage IE group, 7 of 8 patients (88%) achieved CR. The 2-year OS rate was 88%. The side effects of 3D-CRT were temporary and acceptable.\\nConclusion: In our experience, the treatment policy for NK/T cell lymphoma of nasal cavity using 3D-CRT with greater than 50 Gy to gross tumor/tumor bed plus adequate margin was feasible.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To determine the factors affecting the apoptosis of hepatoma cells by irradiation.\\nMethods and Materials: The mean percentages of apoptotic cells were determined using confocal microscope after hepatoma cells were irradiated with a single dose of 20 Gy and stained using TUNEL stain. The level of Bcl-2 protein and glutathione (GSH) content in the naive cell lysate was measured using ELISA. The ratio of hepatoma derived growth factor (HDGF)/β-tubulin of the untreated cells was calculated from the protein band in Western blot gel after densitometer quantization. The Pearson correlation between each paired parameters and the apoptosis were compared and correlation coefficiency was measured for their relationship.\\nResults: The expressed factors were listed as 419, 204, 58, and 22 units/mg for Bcl-2 in the tested Mahlavu, Hep G2, Hep SK, and Hep 3B cell lysates. The GSH content were 95, 247, 70, and 177 umol/mg and the HDGF/ beta-tubulin ratio were 0.827, 0.152, 0.987, and 0.520 in those 4 cell lines. The level of HDGF/β-tubulin was inversely correlated with GSH (R^2=0.994, p=0.0032). However, Bcl-2 amounts did not correlate with GSH or HDGF/β-tubulin. Linear correlation was also observed between apoptosis and GSH except Mahlavu cell with R2 value of 0.98 (p=0.05). Mahlavu cell, with highest Bcl-2 level, exhibited relatively lower level of apoptosis.\\nConclusions: The HDGF, GSH, and Bcl-2 were expressed differently among these four hepatoma cell lines with different level of radiation-induced apoptosis. The HDGF/beta-tubulin level correlated well with GSH activity. HDGF levels in the 4 hepatoma cells correlated with the degree of the radiation-induced apoptosis treated with 20 Gy. However, this differential apoptotic effect among the four different Hepatoma cell lines can not be solely attributed to the amount of GSH or HDGF contents. Highest Bcl-2 concentration was observed in the Mahlavu cell which might rescue the apoptotic effect due to irradiation. Further investigation for the Bcl-2 effect on GSH is necessary to elucidate this relationship to explore the possibility of using the combined pattern of these biomarkers as the prognostic factors.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Radiochromic film has gained increasing popularity in medical applications in recent years. It has several advantageous features, including high spatial resolution, relatively low spectral sensitivity, near tissue equivalence, and it requires no special development procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the response of new type Gafchromic EBT film for high energy photon beams in clinical use. \\nMaterial and Methods: The ISP Gafchromic EBT film (prototype A) and ELEKTA Precise LINAC were used in this study. Gafchromic EBT films were exposed to radiation of difference energies, dose rates, fractionation and to the ambient light respectively. After completely being exposed, we scanned the film with Radlink Laserport 16 scanner and Epson Perfection 4990 photo scanner in red, blue, green channel and gray scale respectively. The post-exposure density growth with varied time was also evaluated. The calibration curves for high energy photon beams were established.\\nResults: The results showed that the effect of dose fractionation was insignificant, and there is no significant energy dependence on 4MV, 6MV and 10MV photon beams. The response using red light source of Epson scanner against corresponding delivered dose is higher than that of the green, blue channel, gray scale and Radlink LaserPor scanner at doses below 4 Gy. The gray scale model showed the lowest response in all scanners. It is interesting that the green light source would have the highest response when the dose was greater than 4 Gy. The post-exposure density growth test showed a slight increase between 1st to 5th day, at sixth day, an obvious decrease occur, then became stable between 7th to 14th day. However, the net OD was nonlinear with time and dose, continuous exposure to the room light for 24 hours resulted in a density change of about 0.117, which is equivalent to a radiation exposure of about 10 cGy.\\nConclusion: Gafchromic EBT film is a new type of film for radiotherapy dosimetry. Its response to different dose rates and dose fractionations were insignificant, but theresults of the effect for room light exposure were not as good ad expected. However, it is still a reliable dosimeter for clinical dosimetry. Our suggestion is to read the film at least 24 hours after irradiation, and scan the films with color scanner in red channel to obtain better response. Furthermore, the film should be kept properly when not in use to avoid other confoundedly influences.',\n",
       " 'Purposes: The radiation dosimeters are used to measure the nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients who are treated by the IMRT technique. The organs doses from scatter radiation are measured, and then the risk is evaluated. For stochastic effect, we estimate the risk for these patients to increase the chance of secondary malignancy and other possible late biological effects.\\nMaterials and Methods: First of all, we calibrated the energy and output factor for 6 MV x-ray from a linear accelerator (Elekta Precise-Sli). One monitor unit (MU) output was calibrated as 1 cGy. The accuracy and sensitivity of TLD-100H dosimeters were also measured. TLD-100H dosimeters within 3% accuracy were applied in the study. TLD-100H dosimeters were placed in different anatomical positions of the Rando phantom, then the Rando phantom was irradiated the head and neck area as NPC treatment by IMRT technique. The data of different organs doses were obtained separately for each of IMRT irradiation. The tissue fatal cancer probability and total risk were estimated following the ICRP Publication No.60.\\nResults: Total radiation dose in the IMRT treatment course was 72 Gy in 40 fractions. Len received 4.03 Gy, which had relatively risks to induce cataract. Heart received 0.86 and kidney received 0.19 Gy, which were far less than their maximal tolerance dose. According to the data calculation from ICRP Publication No.60 the lung and esophagus have about 1~7% fatal cancer probability, which depended on the distance of the position from radiation fields. The fatal cancer probability rate for others organs were 0.04~0.1%.\\nConclusion: The overall risks for inducing fatal cancer is about 0.75%, and the risks for the adjacent tissues to the radiation fields are about 7%. However, a long term evaluation for young cancer patients with curable attempt is feasible.',\n",

Clinical charts, pathology reports, radiology images and radiotherapy records were reviewed. Patients' characteristics, details of treatment modalities and clinical outcome were collected. Sixteen patients were re-staged with three staging system including: Kadish, Dulguerov and the 6th AJCC staging system for nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Histo-pathological specimens of 17 patients were reviewed to define the tumor grading using Hyams' four-tier system.\\nResults: There were 9 male and 8 female, age ranged from 14 to 74 years old. According to Kadish's classification, there were 3 stage A, 3 stage B and 10 stage C diseases. The most common symptom was epistaxis. Thirteen patients received treatment at our institute. A median follow-up time of 40.3 months (mean: 48.6 months), 6 patients were alive without disease and 4 were alive with disease. Locoregional failure occurred in 5 patients and distant metastases were noted in 2 patients. Five-year overall survival rate was 52.5% and 5-year disease free survival rate was 42%. Degree of surgery was the only significant prognostic factor in univariate analysis (p=0.021).\\nConclusion: In this study, surgical intervention to total removal of the tumor was the most significant prognostic factor. Adjuvant treatment such as radiotherapy was needed for advanced diseases, in which residual tumor was notified even after radical surgery. Radiotherapy combined with surgical resection was an effective modality for treatment of olfactory neuroblastoma; this combination could provide excellent local control. Most tumors were response to the initial radiotherapy at the range of 55 to 65 Gy. Elective neck irradiation was not needed routinely. Local recurrence might happen even 5 years later, and long-term follow-up should be mandated.\",\n",
       " 'The main treatment for thymoma is surgery. The role of radiotherapy is adjuvant or palliative treatment. But when the state of thymoma with intracardiac and intracaval invasion occurs, surgery becomes difficult and radiotherapy becomes the first choice of treatment. Thymoma is relatively radiosensitive. Radiotherapy may achieve satisfactory symptom relief and local control. Recently, the improvement of technique and equipment including three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, image guided radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery increases the treatment result of radiotherapy. These techniques increase the tumor dose and decrease the normal tissue dose. We report a case of intracardiac and intracaval invasive thymoma treated with radiotherapy alone and resulted in good local control.',\n",

With careful patient selection, radiotherapy is a safe, simple alternative to surgery for BCC of the eyelid, yielding good local control and cosmetic results.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To investigate the prognostic factors for survival and locoregional control in patients with stage I-IV hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) treated with curative-intent laryngeal preservation radiotherapy (LPRT).\\nMaterials and Methods : From January 1996 through June 2005, 130 patients with stage I-IV squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx were enrolled in this retrospective analysis. The pyriform sinus was the principle site of involvement in 126\\ncases. All patients received 1.8 Gy daily up to a total dose of 68.4 to 82.4 Gy (median 70.2 Gy). Ninety-eight patients (75.4%) received chemotherapy combined with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Actuarial survival (AS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and local relapse-free survival (LRFS) were calculated, and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox’s proportional hazards model.\\nResults : With a median follow-up duration of 39 months (range 14 to 120 months), the 5-year AS/DSS was 56%/64% for patients with stage I-II disease, 30%/43% for stage III disease, and 14%/15% for those with stage IV disease. The 5-year LRFS rate was 34% for all patients, 66% for patients with stage I-II disease, 46% for stage III disease, and 18% for those with stage IV disease (p = 0.004). Multivariate analyses showed that stage\\nIV disease was an independent prognostic factor for local recurrence (p = 0.002).\\nConclusions : Patients with stage I-II disease are suitable for LPRT. Indiscriminate use of LPRT for stage III disease is still problematic because nearly half of these patients had\\nunsuccessful outcomes. For most patients with stage IV, the treatment results were poor.\\nMore aggressive combined modality treatment should be considered.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Thymic carcinoma is a rare malignant mediastinal tumor. It is usually found at a late stage and the prognosis is poor. This retrospective study reviewed the treatment results of patients with advanced stage thymic carcinoma and analyzed the prognostic factors.\\nMaterials and Methods : This retrospective study was to analyze 29 patients with advanced thymic carcinoma who received radiotherapy in our hospital between 1992 and 2005. Because of incomplete course of radiotherapy, lost follow-up, or double cancer, five patients were excluded. The treatment modality included external beam radiotherapy, tumor resection or cisplatin-based chemotherapy.\\nFractionated radiotherapy was given in conventional or 3D conformal techniques. The characteristics of patients, receiving tumor resection, chemotherapy, the dose of radiotherapy in inoperable patients and treatment modality were analyzed to find the prognostic factors for overall survival retrospectively.\\nResults : The median age was 58 year-old. The median radiotherapy dose of 24 patients was 54.5 Gy. The Karnofsky performance status was 70 for 4 of the patients, and above 80 for the rest. Seven patients received surgical resection, and 9 patients had cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The survival\\nrate was improved by receiving surgical resection significantly in univariate analysis (p= 0.017) but not by the completeness of tumor resection, the dose of radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. In multivariate analysis of these factors, only receiving surgical resection still remained to improve the survival rate (p= 0.046). The median overall survival time was 26 months. One-year survival rate was 78.3% and 3-year survival rate was 15.3%. Local recurrence occurred in 5 patients, and the relapse time\\nwas from 2 to 49 months. The local control rate of 22 patients at 1 and 2 years was 64.6% and 37.7% respectively.\\nConclusion : There is no effective treatment protocol for patients with advance stage thymic carcinoma. In our study, we found tumor resection as an important prognostic factor in advanced stage thymic carcinoma. For unresectable thymic carcinoma, the roles of radiotherapy and chemotherapy\\nremain ambiguous.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To compare the efficacy and long-term survival rates between the treatments of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) combined with and without thalidomide for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for whom\\ntransarterial embolization (TAE) or percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) was ineffective or unsuitable.\\nMaterials and Methods : From January 2001 to October 2004, 37 advanced HCC patients who received 3D-CRT at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan were enrolled in this retrospective study. They were diagnosed as HCC during May 1999 to September 2004. Six patients with Child–Pugh class C and 2 patients with nontumor part of liver below 40% were excluded from this study. Seventeen (58.6%) of 29 patients were given thalidomide (100-200 mg/day) concomitantly with 3D-CRT. All treatments were delivered by means of a linear accelerator using 6 or 10 MV photons.\\nRadiotherapy was given 5 days a week with fraction dose of 1.6-1.8 Gy per day. The radiation dose to the target volume ranged from 39.6 to 50.4 Gy (46.8±5.1 Gy). Treatment response, survival rates and factors affecting survival were analyzed.\\nResults : Primary tumor responses were observed in 17 (59%) patients. Age (P = 0.022) and viral hepatitis (P = 0.026) significantly influenced the tumor response.\\nOverall survival rates form the time of diagnosis of 29 patients at 1, 2 and 5 years were 57.5%, 29.0% and 10.1%, respectively. From the time of starting 3D-CRT, survival rates at 6, 12 and 18 months were 50.4%, 19.7% and 11.3%, respectively. The 1-year survival rate was 26.9% and 7.1% in the combined modality group and 3D-CRT alone group, respectively. On univariate analysis, both alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (P = 0.003) and liver cirrhosis (P =0.036) were shown to significantly affect survival. On multivariate analysis, only AFP level (P = 0.001) was shown to significantly affect survival.\\nConclusion : 3D-CRT provides a moderate tumor control in hepatoma patients who failed or were unsuitable for TAE/PEIT. Addition of oral thalidomide may have a benefit\\non short-term survival rate, indicating that vascular disruptive agent could be an adjunct to radiotherapy. Whether this combination improves quality of life remains to be determined.\\nIn addition, higher serum AFP level, especially over 4000 IU/ml, had a signifi-cantly poor survival rate. Further randomized-controlled study is mandatory to identify the efficacy of 3D-CRT combined with thalidomide.',\n",

Among them, lung cancers are the most common primary tumor.\\nThe aim of this retrospective study was to investigate prognostic factors in lung cancer patients with SVC syndrome treated with palliative radiation therapy (RT).\\nMaterials and Methods : From January 1996 to December 2003, 92 lung cancer patients with SVC syndrome were referred for RT. Clinical charts and RT records were reviewed. All patients were followed up until death. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were\\ncalculated and comparisons of different subgroups were made by the log-rank test.\\nResults : Fifty-three of 92 patients completed the planned RT (30 Gy). The median overall survival for all patients was 65 days. Patients without distant metastasis at RT had significantly longer median survival than those with distant metastasis at RT (150 vs. 49 days, p = 0.0038). Patients receiving complete RT had significantly longer median survival than those who received incomplete RT (111 vs. 14 days, p= 0.0006).\\nPatients with Karnofsky performance scale ＞= 70% had significantly longer median survival than those with Karnofsky performance scale ＜70% (107 vs. 44 days, p = 0.0089). Patients with symptom relief after RT had significantly longer median survival than those without symptom relief (113 vs. 15 days, p = 0.0000). With multivariate analysis, only distant metastasis was a significant prognostic factor (p = 0.019).\\nConclusion : Our analysis showed that no distant metastasis at RT, Karnofsky performance scale ＞= 70%, symptom relief after RT, and RT completion were significant favorable prognostic factors for lung cancer patients with SVC syndrome who receivedRT.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To develop a Field-in-Field technique for breast treatment, to produce a uniform dose distribution in the treatment volume, and to efficiently implement this technique in the clinic. \\t \\nMaterial and Methods : Using the Focus planning system, we first employ two tangent fields as in conventional breast treatment technique, but without using the wedge. Based on the dose distribution resulting from these open tangent fields, we create two smaller fields inside each tangent field, to achieve a more uniform dose in the breast volume. The treatment plan including the final six fields are then sent to the treatment database. In the actual treatment, these six fields are properly arranged so that they can be automatically delivered in one sequence without having to enter the treatment room. \\t \\nIn addition, to verify the accuracy of this technique, we used a 2D detector system to measure the delivered dose distribution in a phantom and compare it with the planned results. \\t \\nResults : We compared the treatment plans of the first ten patients using this field-in-field technique with those using the conventional technique. The global maximum dose was reduced by about 5%, the volumes receiving at least 105% and 110% doses were reduced by 28% and 70%, respectively. The total MU was also reduced by about 48%. The in-room time of each patient was reduced by 2 minutes. \\t \\nThe p-values of these comparisons were all less than 0.05. The difference between the measured and \\tthe planned doses were less than 1.6% inside the treatment fields. \\t \\nConclusion : The Field-in-field technique can produce more uniform dose distribution inside the treatment volume for breast treatment. It also reduces the treatment time and lessens the work load for the therapist. This method has been implemented for routine clinical use.',\n",

The method in evaluation of surface dose in intensity modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer has also been developed in this study.  Materials and Methods : The measurements included: (1)measurements of buildup dose in phantom by plane-parallel ionization chamber; (2) measurements of buildup dose in phantom by thermoluminescence dosimeters; (3) measurements of surface dose on head and neck Rando phantom by using thermoluminescence dosimeters. Experiments were performed for 6 MV x-ray  beams generated by a Varian 21EX linear accelerator. The instruments included the Markus plane- parallel ionization chamber and thermoluminescence dosimeters with 0.89 mm, 0.38 mm, and 0.1 \\t \\nmm in thickness, respectively. For normal incident beams, the dose measured in buildup region were corrected with suitable correction equations for plane-parallel ionization chamber and then evaluated the accuracy of the dose measurements in buildup region by using various thickness thermoluminescence dosimeters. The dose at phantom surface for obliquely incident beams were also measured and evaluated by the ultra-thin (0.1 mm) thermoluminescence dosimeters and plane-parallel ionization chamber for small field size (5 cm × 5 cm). For surface dose on the head and neck Rando phantom, the ultra-thin thermoluminescence dosimeters measurements were compared with the treatment planning system calculations. \\t \\nResults : The dose measured in buildup region by using the ultra-thin thermoluminescence dosimeters and Markus chamber are in good agreement and the former is suitable for surface dose measurements in clinical application.

       " 'Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare aggressive tumor of the olfactory mucosa that has been traditionally treated with radical surgical excision. Nevertheless, these rare tumors are still associated with high rates of tumor recurrence and mortality. A novel therapeutic approach using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is presented in this report. \\t \\nWe would like to report a 67 years old construction worker who was referred to our department due to a chief complaint of progressive right cheek pain and right side toothache for 1 month. The patient has been previously seen by a dentist who performed a tooth extraction; however, this did not\\u3000resolve his right cheek pain. A CT scan of the paranasal sinuses performed on May 13, 2004 revealed a large enhancing tumor in the right maxillary sinus with right frontal, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses bone destruction. The patient was referred to the department of ENT for biopsy of the unresectable tumor. The pathologic finding was that of an olfactory neuroblastoma, with the tumor staining positive  for neuron specific enolase. IMRT was given to the patient for a total dose of 6300 cGy (June 30, 2004 to August 20, 2004) concurrently with 2 course of cisplatin iv infusion at 30 mg/m2 per week. \\t \\nA repeat CT scan on Sept. 9, 2004 revealed a residual enhancing tumor of right maxillary sinus with bone invasion. A very small field IMRT boost for 3300 cGy was then given from Oct. 1, 2004 to Nov. 4, 2004. The patient completed the whole course of radiotherapy smoothly with no treatment\\u3000break. A CT scan of the sinus performed on Dec.31, 2006 revealed only frontal, maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinusitis with no evidence of tumor recurrence. Radiation induced right nasolacrimal duct stenosis and obstruction, tearing of the right eye, and decreased vision of both eyes was noted 15 months after IMRT. The stenosis was successfully corrected by surgical ntervention. The patient is still well and alive 29 months after IMRT with no evidence of local recurrence or systemic disease. \\t \\nIMRT in conjunction with weekly cisplatin should be considered as a treatment option in patients with unresectable olfactory neuroblastoma since this technique can deliver an adequate tumorical dose; however, it is unfortunate that the patient developed significant vision impairment due to the high radiation dose to the optic nerves. Careful IMRT treatment planning is necessary to avoid or\\u3000minimize untoward side effects.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: Escalating radiotherapy dose results in a substantial improvement in prostate cancer outcome. Obtaining an optimal plan and acceptable dose distribution would be limited by normal critical structures. Our study is to evaluate the effect of rectal balloon immobilization in reducing rectal dose during daily treatment of prostate cancer with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).\\nMaterials and Methods: From June 2005 to August 2005, 11 patients with prostate cancer underwent computed tomography (CT) simulations with and without rectal balloon (filled with 60ml air) before and at the end of IMRT course. TMS Helax treatment planning system was used to generate step-and-shoot five coplanar-field IMRT plans. Plans were separately designed with and without a rectal balloon. The prescription dose to clinical target volume (CTV) was 78 Gy in 39 fractions of 2 Gy each. CTV was determined according to the patients' risk category. The dose to 95% of planning target volume (PTV) was 78 Gy. Cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the CTV, PTV, rectum, and bladder. Inter-fractional prostate displacement was measured on two separate CT images with the distance between pubic bone rim/sacrum and anterior/posterior borders of prostate, respectively, at the cranial level of pubic symphysis. To assess the dosimetric difference and inter-fractional variation of balloon setup, the paired Student t-test was used.\\nResults: Patients included in this study had the TNM stage distribution of T1cN0M0 in 4 patients, T2bN0M0 in 4 patients, T3bN0M0 in 2 patients, and T4N0M0 in 1 patient. CTV was prostate alone in 8 patients and prostate plus bilateral seminal vesicles in 3 patients. Minimum dose to CTV with and without a rectal balloon were both 79 Gy in average. Average segment number in plans with and without a rectal balloon were 43 and 42 (P=0.7), respectively. Plans with a rectal balloon showed a significant reduction in rectal volume fraction at 65 Gy (13% vs 17%, P=0.007), and at 70 Gy (9% vs 13%, P=0.005). Plans with a rectal balloon did not show difference in bladder volume fraction at 65 Gy (18% vs 16%, P=0.07). Inter-fractional prostate positions before and at the end of IMRT were similar in the distance from pubic bone to anterior border (0.90cm vs 0.96cm, P=0.6), and posterior border of prostate to sacrum (3.69cm vs 3.73cm, P=0.8). All patients tolerated their whole IMRT course with daily placement of rectal balloon. There was no grade Ⅲ acute toxicity. \\nConclusion: Rectal balloon immobilization during daily fractionated IMRT for prostate cancer is a feasible and reproducible procedure. It would be beneficial to reduce high dose to the rectum. The effect of prostate immobilization is acceptable with minimal inter-fractional setup variation.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: The objective of this study is to evaluate the initial treatment outcome of total body irradiation (TBI) in patients with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) who were referred to the Chai-Yi Christian Hospital (CYCH).\\nMaterials and Methods: From August 2002 to August 2004, 12 patients of leukemia or lymphoma were referred to the Chai-Yi Christian Hospital for TBI before BMT. Ten received TBI, and the other two received the simulation procedure only. For TBI, nine received 1200 cGy in 6 fractions over three days, and a child received 1320 cGy in 6 fractions over three days. The distance from focus of linear accelerator (LA) to middle abdomen of patients was 600cm. We used 6MeV photon at the dose rates of 300 and 400 monitor unit (MU) per minute with a Varian LA, but without a compensator. All patients were admitted to the BMT ward under partial aseptic environment. We placed a 1cm lung partial block over thermoplastic shell on the patient's chest and applied the APPA projection technique with a 2cm-thick acrylic sheet around 10cm ahead of the patient.\\nResults: Of the ten patients who received TBI, five survived till January 2005. Only one patient experienced chronic graft vursus host disease with oral mucositis, and the others had no relapse or complications, including a patient with T-anaplastic cell lymphoma who had only partial remission after the chemotherapy. Of the five expired patients, four failed to achieve complete remission and died within two months due to graft failure, secondary infections not related to TBI, or early relapse. Two of them also had venous occlusive liver disease. The patient who had complete remission was a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia who acquired fungal infection three months after the BMT followed by the relapse and died 1.5 years later. The two patients who went through simulation alone had persistent relapse, and infection episodes hindered them from receiving TBI.\\nConclusion: Our results suggest that infections related to the transportation of patients did not appear to be a key prognostic factor in TBI of BMT patients referred from other hospitals. Although the follow-up time is short and patient number is small, we consider the initial outcome satisfactory. Selection of patients is essential for better result, but partial remission from initial chemotherapy may not necessarily destine to failure.\",\n",

       " 'Purpose: External-beam radiotherapy for breast cancer has been shown to reduce the local recurrence. The potentially important gains are often offset by side effect. A major contributing factor to these complications is the inhomogeneity of the dose distribution from tangential irradiation. The objective of this study is to find out the optimal method for breast irradiation which would be applied for clinical patient treatment in the future. \\nMaterials and Methods: Several treatment techniques for tangential breast irradiation were evaluated in this study. The comparisons include two subjects. First, some clinical relevant factors were compared in the result of planning. Second, we will verify the delivery accuracy and delivery time for all techniques using phantom and GAFCHROMIC film. The following four plan techniques were applied for 6 patients: conventional tangents, Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) only tangents, forward IMRT tangents, and conventional open plus IMRT tangents (Hybrid IMRT). \\nResult: The IMRT only tangents, forward IMRT tangents and Hybrid IMRT achieved dose distributions better than conventional tangents. The volume of tissue outside the planning target volume receiving ＞110% of prescribed dose was largest for conventional tangents. Heart volume ＞30 Gy was largest for IMRT only tangents. Average total lung volume ＞20 Gy was largest for IMRT only tangents too. Compare the result in measurement and calculation. Overall, TPS showed good agreement with the measurement in all techniques. However, it was found that there were significant discrepancies in the surface of the phantom. \\nConclusion and Discussion: The hybrid IMRT improve the uniformity of target. The most important is reducing high dose area to the surrounding soft tissue while no increase dose to lung. Besides, planning and treatment time for hybrid techniques is almost the same with conventional technique.',\n",

       " '\\ufeffPurpose : Recent data suggest that postmastectomy patients with locoregional recur-rences are frequently associated with considerable morbidity and present with sys-temic failure. The present study sought to clarify the correlation of radical locoregional therapy with the prevention of further local recurrence, secondary spread, and the improvement of survival. \\t \\nMaterials and Methods : Breast cancer patients who were treated for an isolated postmastectomy locoregional recurrence without simultaneous evidence of distant metastasis were selected from 1992 to 2001. Isolated locoregional recurrence (ILRR) \\t \\nwas defined as any recurrence of tumor in the ipsilateral chest wall, mastectomy scar, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, axillary, or internal mammary lymph node (LN), with no \\t \\nother metastasis. A total of 60 patients, with a median age of 47 years (range 29-75 years) were included. The majority of recurrences occurred at the chest wall and around the mastectomy scar (62%). Supra- or infraclavicular LN recurrence represent-\\t \\ned 22% of all ILRR, and axillary failure represented 16%. Fifty-four patients received irradiation after local tumor excision. Six patients had received radiotherapy as part of their primary treatment. In these cases, the involved-field radiotherapy was given in 36 patients, while 24 patients were treated with both involved-field and elective-field (chest wall and regional lymphatics) locoregional irradiation. Adjuvant systemic therapy con-sisting of either tamoxifen, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or both, along with the recurrent tumor, had been applied in 68.3% of patients. \\t \\nResults : With a median follow-up of 51.5 months, the 4-year actuarial overall survival (OS) after ILRR was 67% for patients with chest wall recurrence. Patients with either axillary, supra- or infraclavicular- recurrence had a 4-year OS of 56%. The 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) for chest wall recurrence and either axillary, supra- or infra-clavicular- recurrence was 56% and 52%, respectively. Seventy-six percent of patients \\t \\nwith a disease-free interval of at least 2 years (late relapse) survived 4 years follow-ing ILRR, as compared to 4-year OS of 39% in those with disease-free interval of less than 2 years (early relapse) (P = .04). The incidence of second ILRR was 8.3% with both involved- and elective-field locoregional irradiation as compared to 22.2% with \\ufeffinvolved-field irradiation alone. Patients who were treated with both involved-field and \\t \\nelective-field locoregional irradiation had the 4-year OS of 69%, and the 4-year DFS of 57%, compared to 55% and 48% of those who were treated with involved-field radiation alone (OS, P = .21; DFS, P = .24). Furthermore, 64% patients who had been treated with adjuvant systemic therapy survived 4 years following ILRR, as compared to 43% for those without additional systemic therapy (P = .08). Similarly, recurrent patients \\t \\nwith adjuvant systemic therapy experienced a 4-year DFS of 60%, compared with 33% for patients without systemic therapy after ILRR (P = .38) Conclusion : A substantial portion of postmastectomy patients with locoregional recur-rence sustain an unexpected long DFS and OS after curative therapy. Therefore, com-prehensive radiotherapy should be used to provide optimal locoregional control and to prevent secondary dissemination in patients with ILRR.',\n",

The new planning technique also used beams with equally-spaced gantry angles but only for the neck above the shoulder. We made beams above the shoulder with a slightly lower field border (normally 3 to 5 mm), to have a built-in feathering. Three of the nine beams treated the entire neck, including the lower neck and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Only three beams are required to split and therefore the total number of fields is 12. The AAPM TG-40 recommended an accuracy of field size and jaw symmetry calibration to be within 2 mm. Hence, for an accelerator operating within these guidelines, \\t \\ntwo abutting fields can overlap or gap up to 2 mm. Field mismatches of ±1 mm and ±2 mm because of imperfect jaw/MLC calibration were simulated. We used film to measure junction inhomogenity. \\t \\nResults : The new technique could be used to successfully generate IMRT plans for head and neck cancers. Both conventional IMRT and CR IMRT had almost the same conformity index and \\t \\nhomogeneity index. Upon evaluating the dose distribution of critical organs, we found all of them were within the tolerance ranges. Film measurements showed that dose inhomogeneities that resulted from 1 mm, 2 mm, 4 mm junction area as jaw/MLC calibration errors were reduced from as large as ±12%, \\t \\n±22%, ±41% with the single-isocenter and half-beam (SIHB) technique to less than ±6% 、±8%, ±12% with this newly developed technique. \\t \\nConclusion : Compared with the conventional SIHB technique, the new technique provides superior dose homogeneity in the abutment region between the supraclavicular and head-and-neck IMRT \\t \\nfields. With a modulating lower border of fields, the feathering mechanism substantially reduces \\ufeffdose inhomogeneities that result from imperfect jaw/MLC calibration.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Clinically it is important for patients to have the supporting and the immobilization during radiotherapy. When using a posterior-anterior beam, radiation normally passes through the treatment couch insert of the linear accelerator and the immobilization devices. With high energy photon beam \\t \\nattenuated by the couch insert and immobilization devices, the skin sparing effect will be reduced. \\t \\nThis study is to investigate the dosimetric changes in the Superficial layer dose of the treated object after high energy photon beam passes through the treatment couch (Perspex) insert and immobilization devices. \\t \\nMaterials and Methods : The gantry angle was set as 180°, so that the posterior-anterior photon beam incidents to the couch insert. Measurements were taken for the different combinations of the couch insert and vacuums with 4 beam sizes: 10 × 10 cm2, 15 × 15 cm2, 20 × 20 cm2, and 25 × 25 cm2 . \\t \\nResults : The thicker the vacuum, the larger increase in the Superficial layer dose. The proportion of Superficial layer dose increase was relative larger with smaller field size. There was significant influence of the dose from the couch insert. The magnitude of the influence was relative larger with \\t \\nsmaller field size. The Superficial layer dose with couch insert was 191% of the one with none of each other at the 10 × 10 cm2 field size. The Superficial layer dose with couch insert was 161% of the one with none of them at the 25 × 25 cm2 field size.\\nConclusion : The uses of the couch inert and immobilization devices cause the increased Superficial layer dose. Special considerations need to be taken in these conditions for the possible radiation related skin injury. The impact should be incorporated into the treatment design.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic factors and treatment outcomes in patients of endometrial cancer with treatments of surgery followed by radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: From August 1993 to April 2004, there were 69 patients diagnosed as endometrial cancer at our hospital. The median age at diagnosis was 55 years (ranged from 34 to 80 years). According to the FIGO staging system for cancer of the uterine body, 46 patients (67%) were stage Ⅰ, 8 (12%) were stage Ⅱ, 12 (17%) were stage Ⅲ, and 3 (4%) were stage Ⅳ. Fifty-eight patients (84%) had endometrioid carcinomas and 11 patients (16%) had non-endometrioid carcinomas: 4 were leiomyoscarcomas, 3 were MMMTs (malignant mixed mullerian tumor), 2 were papillary serous carcinomas, 1 was clear cell carcinoma, and 1 was mixed mucinous and small cell carcinoma. All 69 patients underwent surgery. Sixty-three (91%) of these 69 patients received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy.\\nResults: The median follow-up duration was 38 months (ranged from 8 to 129 months). During the follow-up period, 60 patients (87%) were alive, and 9 patients (13%) died. Three patients (4%) had local recurrence. Nine patients (13%) had distant metastases. The actuarial 5-year overall survival rate was 85%. In univariate analysis, stage was a significant prognostic factor for overall survival, favoring early stages (p=0.0298). Pathological cell type was also a prognostic factor for overall survival, favoring cell type of endometrioid carcinoma (p=0.0063). Lymph node metastasis was another significant prognostic factor affecting overall survival, favoring status without lymph node metastasis (p=0.0469). In multivariate analysis, pathological cell type continued to be a significant prognostic factor for overall survival, favoring cell type of endometrioid carcinoma (p=0.045).\\nConclusions: The 5-year overall survival rate of 85% was achieved in our report of patients of endometrial cancer treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy. Stage, pathological cell type and lymph node metastasis were significant prognostic factors affecting overall survival based on our study. Longer follow-up of these patients and accrual of more patients are needed to evaluate long-term survival and treatment outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To study the locoregional tumor control in postoperative radiotherapy of head-and-neck cancer in relation to the duration of the surgery-radiotherapy interval, overall radiation treatment time (OTT), and treatment gap.\\nMethods and Materials: This retrospective study included 141 patients with cancer of head and neck, treated with surgery first, followed by postoperative irradiation between 1996 and 2004. The patients who had recurrence before radiotherapy or only received biopsy were not included. The median of the total radiation dose, surgery-radiotherapy interval, and the overall treatment time were 61.2 Gy, 34 days, and 48 days respectively. No interruption during radiotherapy (except for weekend breaks) was found in 27.7% of patients. Twenty point six percent of patients had more than 5 days of gap.\\nResults: The median duration of follow-up was 14 months. The median recurrence-free survival time was 34 months. Recurrence developed in 61 patients (43.3%). Increased surgery-radiotherapy interval to more than 30 days was significantly related to a decrease in recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p=0.0328). However, the duration of OTT and treatment gaps did not influence RFS significantly.\\nConclusions: In our study, increased surgery-radiotherapy interval to more than 30 days would cause an adverse effect. Although the overall treatment time and treatment gap did not affect RFS significantly, we should do our best to shorten the surgery-radiotherapy interval and avoid the treatment gaps.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Radical cystectomy has been the standard treatment for invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of urinary bladder. Transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TUR-BT) and radiotherapy (RT) provide an alternative option to cystectomy for organ preservation. The trimodality therapy (TMT) incorporating neoadjuvant and concurrent chemotherapy (CHT) seems to improve the treatment result. This study is to evaluate the short-term outcome and treatment-related toxicity of the TMT for bladder preservation.\\nMaterials and Methods: From 2000 to 2004, 37 patients with invasive bladder TCC undergoing bladder preservation therapy were reviewed retrospectively. Among them, 21 patients received radical TUR-BT followed by RT alone. The other 16 patients who had complete response or good partial response after radical TUR-BT and neoadjuvant CHT received further RT or concurrent chemoradiation. The RT protocol was 45Gy to small pelvis field and 50.4Gy to whole bladder, plus tumor bed boost to a total dose of 64.8Gy with daily fraction size of 1.8Gy in the TMT group. Patients in the RT alone group received 60Gy to whole bladder or 40Gy to whole pelvis plus 20Gy boost to whole bladder with daily fraction size of 2.0 Gy. Interval cystoscopy was performed to confirm the status of complete response for continuation of RT in the TMT group.\\nResults: The median age was 61.8 in the TMT group and 76.8 in the RT alone group. Thirty patients were male and seven were female. In the TMT group, fourteen patients had complete response after radical TUR-BT and induction CHT. Seven patients (43.7%) in the TMT group had grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity, and two of them died of treatment toxicity. The other five patients completed their treatment course with modification of CHT. In the RT alone group, only one patient (4.7%) had grade 3 acute toxicity. The median follow-up was 14.6 months in the TMT group and 21 months in the RT alone group. In the 14 patients completing TMT, two patients experienced local recurrence and none of 16 patients had distant metastasis. In the RT alone group, eight of 21 patients had local recurrence while 7 patients had distant metastasis. The one-year locoregional control rates were 93.3% in TMT group and 72.0% in RT alone group (p=0.11). The one-year metastasis-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 100% and 73.3% (p=0.047), 93.3% and 62.3% (p=0.05), and 87.5% and 79.8% (p=0.23), respectively.\\nConclusion: At the cost of increased acute toxicity, TMT for bladder preservation provides significant better metastasis-free survival and favorable disease-free survival. Our protocol seems feasible and well tolerated in most patients. With limited follow-up, the result of TMT remains satisfactory in selected patients. Longer observation is needed to confirm the ultimate success of bladder preservation.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This prospective, nonrandomized study was conducted to test the efficacy and toxicity of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) using uracil-tegafur (UFUR) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.\\nMaterial and Methods: From February 2001 through November 2004, 17 patients with stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled in the study. All underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant CCRT at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei. The median age was 54 (range, 42 to 86) years. The operative procedures were either abdominoperineal resection or a radical proctectomy. Radiotherapy (RT), delivered in 28 to 33 fractions, consisted of 45Gy of whole-pelvis irradiation followed by a 5.4 to 14.4Gy local boost to the tumor bed. A combination of oral UFUR at 200 to 250 mg/m2/day and LV 45 to 60 mg/day was given 7 days a week during the RT course and then for at least one year or until treatment failure, whichever came first.\\nResults: Of the 17 patients, 7 were male and 10 were female. Five had undergone APR and 12 RP. The adenocarcinoma was moderately differentiated in 15 poorly differentiated in 2. The median radiation dose was 59.4 (range, 50.4 to 59.4)Gy, with a mean 57.7Gy. None of the patients died during the CCRT course. The median survival for all 17 patients was 36 months, and the 3-year overall survival was 68%. The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 44%. Four patients developed local failure, yielding a 3-year local control rate of 68%. Five patients developed distant metastasis, for a 3-year metastasis-free rate of 62%. The most-common side effects were diarrhea and nausea or vomiting, dermatitis, fatigue, and hematological toxicity consisting of anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. Three patients had grade 3 diarrhea, and 1 grade 3 fatigue and vomiting, but these were tolerable. None had greater than grade 2 skin toxicity. One patient had grade 3 anemia, but none had grade 3 leucopenia or thrombocytopenia.\\nConclusions: Adjuvant CCRT that includes oral UFUR and LV provided acceptable survival and local control rates with acceptable toxicity in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. A randomized trial of this combined treatment is warranted.',\n",
       " 'Objective: Toxicity to normal tissues remains a major treatment-limiting factor in concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). This study was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of amifostine used along with CCRT to treat head and neck cancer.\\nPatients and Methods: The medical records of 16 patients with head and neck cancer treated from June 2001 to November 2003 with CCRT plus amifostine in our department were retrospectively analyzed. The primary tumor was in the nasopharynx in 6, oropharynx in 6, and oral cavity in 4. Radiotherapy (RT) was administered to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes at a dose of 64.8 to 72Gy over 7 to 8 weeks. Chemotherapy consisted of 6 weekly doses of cisplatin (30 mg/m^2) given approximately\\n1 hour prior to RT. A rapid 3-minute intravenous infusion of amifostine, 300 mg/m^2, was given 15 minutes before each RT fraction. All patients were examined at the end of each week. Adverse effects of amifostine were recorded.\\nResults: In 8 of the 16 patients (50%), the amifostine therapy had to be discontinued or reduced because of amifostine-related toxicity. The dose was reduced to 210 mg/m^2 in 5 patients and stopped completely in another 3. Amifostine-related adverse effects resulted in delay of RT by 2 to 7 days in 7 of the 16 patients, and RT could not be completed in 1 patient. Long-term amifostine-related toxicity was not observed.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To determine the RBE of the BNCT epithermal neutron beam produced at THOR for a reference biological system and reference irradiation conditions.\\nMaterials and Methods: Intestinal crypt regeneration in mice was chosen as biological system. No boron compound was administrated. RBE was determined relative to cobalt-60 gamma rays for two irradiation conditions corresponding to different gamma and ”non-gamma” absorbed dose mixtures.\\nResults: The RBE(subscript beam) (i.e. considering the beam ”as it is”, with all dose components and its actual dose rate) was found equal to 1.5 and 1.9 for absorbed dose mixtures comprising 75 and 70% of gamma respectively. Assuming that the RBE of the gamma dose component is equal to unity and deriving the RBE of the non-gamma dose component, RBE(subscript non-γ) values of 2.9 and 4.0 were obtained from the data of the first and second absorbed dose mixture respectively. Comparing the THOR data with those obtained from the same system in 6 other BNCT facilities worldwide, large differences between the RBE(subscript beam) are observed, even when comparing those beam configurations exhibiting similar absorbed dose mixtures. There is, however, a general trend for the RBE(subscript beam) to increase slightly with increasing non-gamma dose component contribution. The derived RBE(subscript non-γ) exhibit also large differences, but average 3.4, which value is close to the one currently apply in clinical practice for determining the ”total biologically weighted dose”.\\nDiscussion and Conclusion: The THOR data as well as those of the other facilities exhibit a certain degree of internal consistency in that the RBE(subscript beam) increases with the non-gamma dose component. However, the RBE differences between institutions appear too large to be explained only by the difference in the composition of the beams and in dose rate (power of the reactor). It is likely that lessening the dosimetric uncertainties and adopting common dosimetric protocols would restore some homogeneity in the radiobiological data. As such experiments constitue an overall check of the irradiation procedure (including dosimetry), they should be undertaken for the commissioning of new installations or on the occasion of any substantial upgrade.',\n",

       " \"Purpose: To report the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of a case of a malignant mesothelioma.\\nMaterials and Methods: A case of a malignant mesothelioma of the right pleural cavity is reported here. This 65-year-old male patient had an initial complaint of persistent cough with blood-tinged sputum for 3 months, and associated symptoms were progressive shortness of breath and body weight loss. Because the patient's chest x-ray revealed right pleural effusion, the initial impression was lung cancer. A chest CT scan was performed and revealed a right infrahilar mass with atelectasis of the right lower lung, and a small nodular density in the right upper anterior lung segment. The final diagnosis of the CT scan was lung cancer of the right lower bronchus with atelectasis and right pleural effusion. A repeat chest PA after pleural fluid drainage revealed thickening of the right visceral and parietal pleurae. A thoracotomy with a pleural biopsy was performed 2 weeks after the CT scan. The pathology revealed an epithelial-type well-differentiated malignant mesothelioma; CK and EMA stains were positive, while CEA stain was negative. The TNM staging was T2N1M0. Radiotherapy was then arranged for this patient. A CT scan of the entire chest cavity in 5-mm slices was performed prior to radiotherapy for treatment simulation with a GE lightspeed scanner. Radiotherapy treatment planning was done with the Eclipse RTP system, version 6.5. Intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was given to the entire right visceral and parietal pleurae for a total dose of 64.6Gy in 38 fractions over a 61-day period from Febuary 12 to April 22, 2003. The patient also received a course of chemotherapy with 100 mg cisplatin iv given 4 days before the start of radiotherapy.\\nResults: The patient, who was followed-up in the outpatient clinic every month, had suffered no local recurrence by 6 months after radiotherapy, and a follow-up CT scan showed slight pleural effusion with progressive regression of the right pleural cavity. The patient suffered a brain metastasis in October 2003. Palliative radiotherapy for the entire brain was given from October 18 to November 20, 2003 for a total dose of 42.5Gy. The patient unexpectedly expired on November 30, 2003.\\nConclusions: IMRT is an alternative treatment option for a malignant mesothelioma which is otherwise unsuitable for a radical extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP). No severe radiation-induced pneumonitis was noted even with the high dose of IMRT. More clinical trials are needed to determine the benefit of this new treatment modality.\",\n",

Tumor work-up and follow-up were documented by physical examination, image studies (CT, MRI, sonography), colonoscopy and CEA. The applied TNM staging system was based on the AJCC manual of staging of cancer 6th edition, 2002. The adjuvant radiation was delivered with linear accelerator and the radiation dosage ranged from 45 Gy to 61.2 Gy. The adjuvant chemotherapy was given with 5-FU based regimen. The STATA(superscript TM) computer database and SPSS were used for statistic analysis.\\nResult: Of these 72 patients, the mean age was 56.4 years (median 60), the 3- and 5- year overall survival rates were 68 % and 53%, respectively; local control rates were 85% and 83%, respectively; the disease free survival rates were 47% and 41%, respectively. There were 18 patients under age 50 and 54 patients older than age 50. The survival rate for the younger was worse than the older in our study, but without statistic significance (p=0.2618). The resection specimen with blood vessel or lymphovascular permeation, inadequate margin and adjacent organs invasion resulted in a poor prognosis. The pretreatment CEA level more than 20 ng/ml was a significant risk factor for survival after stage was adjusted but not significant for local control or disease control.\\nConclusion: For colorectal cancer receiving surgery and post -operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the pathologic finding of lymphovascular permeation, blood vessel invasion and unclear margin are of prognostic significance. The pretreatment CEA level more than 20 ng/ml was also a risk factor.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: In response to the AAPM TG-51 protocol, the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) fabricated a pancake graphite ionization chamber as the primary standard for the absorbed dose to water in 60Co. Meanwhile, INER cooperated with 13 domestic hospitals in measurements of the absorbed dose to water of 6 MV and 10 MV high-energy photon beams respectively based on the AAPM TG-21 and TG-51 protocols to analyze the dosimetry differences under the two protocols. A quality assurance guide for institutions switching from the TG-21 to TG-51 protocol was suggested based on the comparison results of these two dosimetry protocols.\\nMaterial and Methods: INER completed the assessment and measurement of the physical parameters and correction factors of the pancake graphite ionization chamber and then made a bilateral comparison with ARPANSA/Australia for the standards of absorbed dose to water in 60Co by using three NE 2571 ionization chambers as transfer items. Also, INER used a 60Co irradiator in performing chamber calibrations in terms of the air kerma and absorbed dose to water. As to the measurement conditions of the absorbed dose to water for the 6 MV and 10 MV high-energy photon beams, they were based on the AAPM TG-51 protocol at 100 cm SSD (or SAD), 10 cm×10 cm irradiation field and 10 cm calibratoin depth.\\nResults: The difference of the INER-ARPANSA bilateral comparison of the standards of the absorbed dose to water in 60Co was within 0.3%, which was less than the combined standard uncertainty (k=1). It showed that both laboratories had good agreement in measurement results. For the 5 types of cavity ionization chambers used by the 13 dosmetic hospitals, the ratios of the absorbed dose to water calibration coefficient against the air kerma calibration coefficient in 60Co were between 1.094 and 1.105, showing similar results within tight limits (envelop of ±0.6%), At the same time, for all the 13 participants, the measurement differences of the absorbed dose to water for 6 MV and 10 MV high-energy photon beams based on the TG-21 and TG-51 dosimetry protocols were less than 1.5%.\\nConclusions: The manufacturers and structures of medical accelerators and ionization chambers will not cause differences in dose measurement either it was TG-51 or TG-21 protocol that had been used. If an institution determines TG-5 or TG-21 ratios measurably different (＞1.5%) than the values presented in this paper, it should recheck the correctness of calculation parameters and measurement data used in both protocols.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study aimed to develop an advance precision three-dimensional (3-D) image segmentation algorithm to enhance the blurred edges clearly and then introduce the result onto the intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for tumor targeting. This will achieve what physicians usually demand that tumor doses escalation characteristics of IMRT.\\nMaterials and Methods: No doubt the Wavelet method is well known to be one of the best gradient segmentation methods due to its multi-scale and multi-resolution capabilities. We extend the standard Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) into two dimensions. By applying this 2-D DWT algorithm one may develop a new edge detection method. But for practical purposes, we replace the traditional 2-D wavelet functions with a 2-D discrete periodic wavelet transform (2-D DPWT). Finally, by using Daubechies wavelet transform function to form the wavelet masks for convolution operation in image processing, it allows us to detect edges at different scales for segmentation. Linear interpolation and edges linking and thinning algorithm were then used to form 3-D renderings. A proposed algorithm flowchart designed for this precision 3-D treatment targeting was introduced in this paper. Different medical images were used to test the validity of our method. We then compared the results with a traditional region growing segmentation approach to show that our 3-D renderings not only achieved the precision we sought but also has many interesting applications that shall be most useful to the medical practice.\\nResults: Two CT scan data and one MRI data of different medical images were used to verify the validity of our proposed method. One CT scan dataset from a human chest was test first to extract the right lung for feature extraction. Its wavelet segmentation result was shown in the Figs. 3, 4, 5 and the region growing method was also shown for comparison. The second dataset was a CT scan of a female patient with a pituitary tumor in her brain. The size and shape of the tumor, its orientation with the brain, and the position relative to the head are all now clearly seen. Figures 6, 7 clearly demonstrated the results of our segmentation capable of providing an outstanding positioning of the tumor. In the third experiment of an MRI data, we demonstrate how colors were used in our 3-D renderings to enhance the important parts. 3-D reconstruction of the brain in a partial skull is shown in Fig. 10 (d) with different colors to emphasize their relative positions. On all examples of medical images we created, not only desired precision had been achieved, we are also able to create rotation of the objects with transparent effects to obtain its 3-D images of different angles. They will allow physicians to conduct surgery or treatment much more accurately and effectively. Many 3-D images physicians usually only compose by imaginations, now all visible under our 3-D processing. Features are now clearly identified, locations pinned down exactly, and relative orientations are now well understood. These are all vital for radiation therapies.\\nConclusion: The 3-D targeting segmentation we proposed allows physicians to improve the traditional treatments or IMRT much more accurately and effectively. Our precision 3- D wavelet segmentation rendering shall be very useful in practice for medical images. They will play an important role in image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and many other medical applications in the future.',\n",

We can get a gantry angle from the relation avoid the radiation to hit the supporter. Therefore, a set of equation was developed to check if the radiation beam penetrates the couch supporter or not.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) utilizes nonuniform beam profile to provide desired radiation dosage to the tumor volume more accurately. However, the problem of intra-fraction organ motion can cause distortion to the desired beam intensities. This study aims to develop a respiration adaptive technique to toggle the problem of respiratory motion in radiation therapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: A video cue that shows a cyclic moving pattern is shown to the patient to help adjust his respiratory motion. Once the respiratory motion becomes regular, we can predict his respiratory phase during the treatment. The trajectory of the organ due to the respiratory motion can be obtained from the fluoroscopy study. The trajectory is then used to modify the velocities of MLC leaves so that the radiation field is synchronized with organ motion. Once the beam moves with the respiratory motion, the field size can be fixed on the tumor volume and reduce the distortion of dose distribution due to the organ motion.\\nResults and Conclusions: A phantom was built to simulate the respiratory motion. EDR2 films are employed for the measurement of dose distribution. Preliminary results show that modification of MLC can be used to reduce the distortion due to respiration. Visual cue can be used to improve the regularization of respiration. This technique can be applied to clinical cases. The advantage of this Respiration Adaptive IMRT is to eliminate the inaccuracy of the TM field delivery caused from respiration movement without the cost of treatment efficiency. It requires patient's cooperation for regular respiratory motion.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To compare the conventional 2-dimensional (2-D) simulation technique with CT- based 3-D planning method, and verify the feasibility of 2-D method for breast tangential irradiation.\\nMaterials and Methods: From November to December1998, ten successive patients with early-staged breast cancer were enrolled for this study. After immobilization with alpfa-cradle, patient underwent a conventional simulation-method to get the parameters for 2-D treatment plan. Patient also had a chest CT scan and these images were stored for subsequent 3-D treatment plan. These two treatment planning methods were retrospectively compared with their dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the irradiated targets (PTV normal tissue, lung and heart).\\nResults: The PTV covering ratio (2-D vs. 3-D) of these two techniques is 0.95 ± 0.02. For the normal tissue, two-dimensional technique has more chest wall soft tissue included within 50% isodose curve, but there is no significant difference (mean volume 703 ml±205 ml for 2-D vs. 539 ml±197 ml for 3-D, t test p=0.146). For the ipsilateral lung tissue, both methods have equivalent irradiated percentage lung volume (7.5%±3.0% for 2-D vs. 7.6%±4.8% for 3-D). For left-sided breast cancer, the average irradiated heart volumes are 5.4 ml±4.2 ml (2-D) versus 5.8 ml±3.9 ml (3-D).\\nConclusions: Our analysis shows that both planning methods have equivalent irradiated dose-volume histograms. For circumstances where CT scan simulator is not available, conventional 2-D planning method is an acceptable alternative.',\n",
       " 'Chordomas are rare malignant neoplasms. Most chordomas are found at skull base, sacrum and cervical spine. We present a rare case of chordoma with lumbar spine origin and bone metastasis after operation and radiotherapy. In this case, no local recurrence was found in two years after tumor removal and adjuvant radiotherapy, but metastases to right scapula and left femur shaft were found afterward. Besides, the treatment of chordomas remains a challenge. We review the literatures of the clinical feature, pathophysiology, treatment modalities and prognosis of chordomas, and also the newest advances of radiotherapy, including proton beam radiotherapy (RT) and heavy charged particles RT (carbon ions) for treating chordomas.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: To report our preliminary treatment result of AVMs treated by Linac-based Stereotactic Radiosurgery (X-knife).\\nMaterials and Methods: From 1996 to 2004, there were 117 patients treated by X-knife for their brain lesions in this hospital. The median follow-up time was 42 months (range: 6-107 months). These included 26 cerebral AVMs. There were 7 female and 19 male. The mean age at time of SRS was 29 years (range, 8-71 years). For Spetzler-Martin score distribution, there were score 1 (n=9), score 2(n=5), score 3(n=4) and score 4(n=8), respectively. Mean target volume was 7.9 c.c.. Mean peripheral or minimal dose was 13 Gy.\\nResults: No patient had died during the study interval. Twenty-four patients had at least one MRI/MRA follow-up and 8 had catheter angiography. The crude rate of cure was 62.5% (5/8). The crude rate of combined total and partial obliteration was 79.2% (19/24). Median time to complete disappearance of the nidus on MRI/MRA was 28 months (range, 1-82). Median time to complete obliteration verified by conventional angiography was 63 months (range, 33-72). Hemorrhage rate before and after radiosurgery were recorded in 61.5% and 7.7%, respectively. Three patients (11.5%) had brain necrosis with permanent neurological defects and all were treated in the early stage in this study. Significant risk factors for brain necrosis showed target volume more than 7c.c. (P=0.002) and maximum cone size more than 3.0 cm (P=0.04).\\nConclusion: The results of AVM treated by Linac-based SRS in our institute were comparable with other reported data. However, larger sample size with a longer follow-up is needed for a more conclusive comment.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the treatment results of preoperative radiotherapy followed by surgery and the prognostic factors in patients with stage IB to IIB cervical carcinoma.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between July 1986 and December 1988, twenty-six patients with FIGO stage IB (13 patients), IIA (10 patients) and IIB (3 patients) cervical carcinoma were evaluated and treated at the Tri-Service General Hospital. The median age of the patients was 49 years (range 35-65). The median tumor size was 5 cm (range 2-7). The histological types were squamous cell carcinoma (22 patients), adenocarcinoma (2 patients) and small cell carcinoma (2 patients). Preoperative radiotherapy dose to whole pelvis was 3600-4500 cGy (median 3700 cGy). This was followed by 4 fractions of intracavitary brachytherapy providing 3200 cGy to point A. A boost dose of 360-1260 cGy (median 540 cGy) was given to the parametrial area. All patients underwent extrafascial hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 4 to 6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.\\nResults: Twenty-two (84.6%) patients had no residual tumor after hysterectomy, but two patients (7.7%) had parametrial involvement after operation. Complications were observed in 6 (23.1%) patients, all occurred in postoperative period. Five-year overall and disease-free survival was 79.5% and 84.3%, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated poor prognostic factors were adjuvant chemotherapy (p=0.005), parametrial involvement after operation (p=0.007) and age below 40 years old (p=0.017).\\nConclusions: The results of preoperative radiotherapy and surgery showed as comparable as radical hysterectomy or radiotherapy alone, especially for bulky tumor. Residual parametrial involvement after operation remains poor prognosis.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy is a part of the routine care of patients with early breast cancer. However, a subset of patients with left breast cancer has been shown to be at significant risk of cardiac mortality after longer relapse-free survival. This planning study was designed to assess the efficacy of target coverage and cardiac sparing by three intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques compared to three-dimensional tangential radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: Treatment planning study was performed retrospectively on 10 selected left-sided breast cancer patients previously treated by three-dimensional tangential radiotherapy with the prescribed dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. All patients underwent CT scan following their breast conserving surgery. For each patient, plans were generated and compared using dose volume histograms for planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR). Treatment planning was performed using a commercial IMRT system (Eclipse Version 7.1), and the beam fluency was delivered using a step and shoot window leaf sequence and 6-MV beams. Four different radiation techniques were analyzed: (1) 3-dimensional tangential plan (3D), (2) 2-field tangential IMRT plan (2T), (3) 2-field optimized IMRT plan (2O), and (4) 4-field IMRT plan (4I). Doses to the PTV and each OAR were compared using a paired Student's t-test.\\nResults: PTV homogeneity was similar for the four techniques. For all patients, the average part of the PTV receiving a dose between 95 and 107% of the prescribed dose was 96.1%, 97.4%, 96.0% and 97.6% for the 3D, 2T, 2O and 4I plans, respectively. The mean proportion of the heart receiving more than 95/80% of the prescribed dose was 3.4/7.4% for 3D, 2.5/5.8% for 2T, 1.7/4.5% for 2O and 1.2/2.9% for 4I techniques, while the mean proportion of lung receiving more than 20 Gy was 19.6%, 17.5%, 23.9% and 19.3% for the four plans, respectively. When compared to 3D plans, the 41 plans significantly reduced the high dose irradiation volume of heart; however, the irradiated doses to the contralateral breast were increased. The use of IMRT techniques did not increase either V20 Gy of lung or the mean left lung doses.\\nConclusion: Left breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant irradiation in which the heart receiving higher dose should be considered for alternation to IMRT plan. Better cardiac sparing effect is achievable with the use of 4-field IMRT technique without compromising target coverage.\",\n",
       " \"Introduction: Splenic irradiation had been applied for many years as a treatment for various hematologic diseases. Its excellent effects, minimal side effects and low-cost make it as a reasonable treatment policy for palliation. We reviewed our experience of splenic irradiation and discussed its efficacy.\\nMaterials and Methods: Thirteen cases received splenic irradiation at our department from January 2000 to August 2004, and twelve cases were eligible for analysis. Diseases included chronic myelogenous leukemia (4), liver cirrhosis (3), anaplastic anemia (2), acute lymphocytic leukemia (1), Hodgkin's lymphoma (1) and idiopathic myelofibrosis (1). Eighteen courses of radiotherapy were delivered. The radiation treatment techniques consisted of two opposed fields of Co60 and 6 or 15 MV photons targeting to the spleen. The cumulative doses ranged from 500 cGy to 2400 cGy with fraction size ranging from 50 to 160 cGy.\\nResults: Good response was observed in four patients (3 cases of CML, 1 case of idiopathic myelofibrosis) and 7 courses of radiotherapy. Partial response was observed in six patients (2 cases were liver cirrhosis, the other 4 cases were CML, ALL, anaplatic anemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma) and 9 courses of radiotherapy. Two patients were not responsive to the treatment, who were suffering from liver cirrhosis and anaplastic anemia, respectively.\\nDiscussion: Splenic irradiation can achieve good palliate effects for splenomegaly resulting from idiopathic myelofibrosis and hematological malignancies, especial CML. In non-malignant diseases, such as liver cirrhosis and anaplastic anemia, the symptom relief provided by splenic irradiation was not as good as for that of the malignant disease. However, it needs further investigation.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: The conventional verification films and electronic portal images are widely used in the verification of patients' position and the reproducibility of the multi-leaf collimator and block, custom block or cerroben block. The use of verification film is often accompanied by the inconvenience of storing and retrieving. In addition, the importance of using digital images cannot be overemphasized in the modem radiotherapy. We intended to compare digital portal images obtained from computed radiography (CR) system with conventional portal films and the images from electronic portal imaging devices (EPID).\\nMaterials & Methods: The quality of the verification images was based on the contrast of different thickness or density. We took conventional portal films and digital images of a step wedge and an anthropomorphic RANDO Phantom under a 21 EX Varian linear accelerator. Those images were then compared by visual inspection and quantitative analysis method.\\nResults: Based on the step wedge study, CR system could obtain the full gray-scale of images with least MU. In each treatment site (i.e. Head & Neck, Chest & Pelvis), the quality of the CR images was judged to be superior to conventional portal films.\\nConclusion: The operation for the CR system is similar to the tradition verification film. Since they are digital images, they ca be post processed and the anatomic structure can be enhanced in different ways, especially in the lateral fields of pelvis. It provides a better quality of image to verify the accuracy of the treatment position. It seems that the CR system ca provide a better solution for the radiation treatment of cancer.\",\n",

Errors, once identified, were documented, and categorized as calculation, recording, no signature, execution, summation or others errors. We abs analyze the errors with documentation containing an explanation of the error as well as a plan to avoid errors of this type in the future.\\nResults: A total of 54418 charts were reviewed by 304 chart checking execution during the past 6 years. Of these, 936 errors were identified, accounting for a incidence of 1.72% (936/54418). Of these, 0.56%(307/54418), 0.54%(292/54418), 0.2%(110/54418), 0.08%(46/54418), 0.30%(165/54418), 0.03%(16/54418) errors were due to calculation, recording, no signature, execution, summation and others respectively.\\nConclusion: A weekly chart review program can verify that all parameters are consistent from treatment plan to the daily treatment record to the treatment execution. A substantial proportion of treatment errors ca be effectively detected with aid of this program and thus weekly chart review program is an integrated part of quality assurance in a modem radiation oncology department.',\n",
       " 'The therapeutic approaches to intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) vary from craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to focal irradiation with or without chemotherapy. There were several cases reports in favor of the application of radiosurgery in the management of intracranial GCTs. In this report, four cases of presumed germinomas treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) were presented. The first patient, a 25 years old gentleman with presumed pineal germinoma, had spinal seeding at 6 months after 15 Gy of GKRS. After salvage CSI, 4th cranial nerve radiation injury developed. The second patient, a 14 years old boy with basal ganglion germinoma and elevated serum β-HCG, received a 10 Gy upfront GKRS boost but declined the scheduled periventricular irradiation. In-field local recurrence developed at 7 months after the GKRS. After salvage periventricular irradiation, the patient suffered from mild neurological deficit with poor left limb coordination. The third patient, a 30 years old lady with presumed pineal germinoma, had a poor response to therapeutic trial of 10 Gy GKRS. She was given a second course of 9.5 Gy GKRS. The fourth patient, an 18 years old gentleman with presumably pineal germinoma, had tumor control at 3 years after 15 Gy of GKRS. Based on the outcome of these 4 cases, radiosurgery alone is not recommended as the primary treatment for intracranial GCTs.',\n",

We retrospectively studied whether hyperfractionation irradiation to treat T3/T4 NPC patients could decrease the long-term side effect to the brain stem.\\nPatients and Methods: Sixty-nine patients with T3/T4 (American Joint Committee on Cancer, 1997 staging system) NPC were treated with concomitant chemotherapy and twice a day radiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy between September 1991 and December 1998 in Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center, Taipei. The planning dose of radiation was 74.4 Gy in 62 fractions, twice a day, 5 days per week. Every patient had 15 mm safe margin at clivus direction in the initial field to 40.8-43.2 Gy, 7mm to 10 mm to 60Gy at the 2nd boost field, and 3-7 mm at the final boost field to a total dose of 74.4 Gy. Twenty-five patients were treated between 1996 and 1998; their previous treatment plan data could be retrieved for analysis in our current CMS (Computerized Medical Systems, INC) three dimension treatment planning system for dose volume histogram calculation of brain stem. Five patients died from disease within 3 years after completion of treatment were excluded from the analysis.\\nResults: With a minimal and median follow-up of 49 and 97 months, respectively, 5-year local control rate of the 20 patients was 93.8%. Brain stem toxicity was observed in one of 20 patients with the manifestation of grade Ⅱ sensory loss at ipsilateral upper limb. There was no treatment related death. The average maximal dose to brain stem was 75.12 Gy and mean dose was 35.56 Gy.

       " 'Purpose: To compare the difference treatment modalities for complications and long-term quality of life (QoL) in patients with stage IB and stage IIA uterine cervical carcinoma.\\nMaterials and Methods: Three hundred and thirty-six patients of two institutions were invited to participate in this study. Inclusive patients were follow-up at least 2 years after the completion of the treatment (follow-up periods: 25-218 months) and were between ages 45-74 years. According to the treatment modalities, they were divided into 3 groups: surgery (OP), radiation therapy (RT), and surgery with postoperative radiation therapy (OP+RT). All patients were asked to complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ C-30) and complications Questionnaire for the assessment of QoL.\\nResults: Total 8 items of complicatons were statistically significant, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, blood stools, dysuria, urine incontience, edema of lower extremities and hot flush. Constipation, dysuria, and hot flush were statistically higher in OP group; diarrhea and blood stools were highter in RT group. Significant higher complications treated by OP+RT were: diarrhea, blood stools, urine incontience and edema of lower extremities. Comparison of EORTC QLQ-C30, the majority of items showed little difference among these three treatment modalities, except cognitive functioning and social functioning in functional scales and fatique, nausea/vomiting, poor appetite, constipation and economical difficult in symptoms scales.\\nConclusion: Our study revealed the different complications in stage IB and Stage IIA uterine cervical cancer patients treated by different modalities, whereas long-term QoL seem little difference among these three different modalities. These data were helpful for clinical physician not only for selecting treatment modalities when concerning with QoL changes of the patients, but also for rehabilitation and supportive care of the patients after treatment.',\n",

There were 14 men and 7 women. Patients' age ranged from 17 to 88. Presenting symptoms/signs, tumor extent, treatment modalities, survival time, and disease-free survival time were recorded. Ten patients (48%) were treated with conventional two-dimensional technique and 11 (52%) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Patient's performance status was scored with Karnofsky performance scale (KPS). Tumor extent was staged using Kadish system.\\nResults: Of the 21 patients, 2 were Stage A, 3 Stage B, and 16 Stage C. After a mean follow-up time of 35 months, 4 patients are alive with disease and 4 are alive without disease Locoregional failure occurred in 6 patients and distant metastases were noted in 5 patients. Of the 15 initially node-negative patients who did not receive elective neck irradiation, 3 (20%) failed in the neck. Five-year overall survival rate was 42% and 5-year disease free survival rate was 17%. In univariate analysis, age (≦60 vs. ＞60) and KPS (≧80 vs. ＜80) were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (p=0.019, p=0.000, respectively) and disease-free survival (p=0.021, p=0.001, respectively).\\nConclusion: Treatment results in our series are compatible with others. We find that age and KPS are significant prognostic factors in predicting the outcome. Due to relatively high incidence of neck failure, elective neck irradiation seems worthy to be considered in selective patients.\",\n",

       " 'Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is generally suggested for limited-staged small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with complete local response to initial therapies. We presented 6 patients with no evidence of brain metastasis for more than 3-year follow-up after receiving PCI.\\nMaterials and Methods: From November 1998 through January 2002, 6 patients were diagnosed as SCLC in our institution. Five patients (83%) were male and 1 (17%) was female. The median age at diagnosis was 61 years. All patients were classified as limited stage. According to ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status, 1 patient (17%) was scaled to 0, 4 patients (66%) were 1, and 1 patient (17%) was 2. All patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Chemotherapy regimens consisted of cisplatin and etoposide. The median cumulative thoracic irradiation dose was 54Gy. All 6 patients achieved complete local response after CCRT, and then they received PCI with median cumulative dose of 36Gy.\\nResults: All patients were alive and had a long-term follow-up more than 3 years with no evidence of brain metastasis. The longest follow-up duration was 75 months. Three patients (50%) had metastasis to distant sites other than brain, including 2 patients with bone and one patient with kidney metastases.\\nConclusions: In our study, long-term survival with no evidence of brain metastasis was achieved in patients of SCLC receiving PCI after complete local response to initial treatments of CCRT. Distant metastases to other sites still developed in half of these patients. PCI might have benefits in preventing distant metastasis to brain on the respect of failures to other distant sites with long-term follow-up.',\n",
       " 'Dose uniformity is directly related to tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). An ideal situation is one in which a uniform high dose is focused on the tumor target region and normal tissue surrounding the target volume receives minimal radiation. Dose distribution and uniformity must take into account the irregular contours and density changes within the body, especially the head, neck, and breast. A physical wedge has been used to compensate for irregular contours during traditional treatment, but a physical wedge is limited by its fixed angle and size. In addition, it cannot compensate for two dimensions simultaneously. We have developed a two-dimensional dynamic wedge to overcome these limitations.\\nA wedge-shaped dose map was calculated for this study. The dose map was transferred to a fluence map in a CadPlan treatment planning program to generate a multileaf motion file. We created 6 dynamic wedges and verified them by phantom measurements. The maximum differences in the beam profiles between the calculated values and the measured values were 1.8%, 1.7%, and -1.8% when measured for wedges at 45 degrees, 15 degrees, and 38 degrees in the X direction, and -2.6% and -2.3% when measured for wedges at 20 and 30 degrees in the Y direction. The differences between the isodose curves for the two-dimensional dynamic wedges were less than 2% and 2mm. Absolute doses also showed good agreement between calculated and measured values in this study such that all differences were less than 3%.\\nThe two-dimensional dynamic wedge developed in this study may be valuable for simulating isodose curves and can be used for CadPlan treatment planning which is currently used in many hospitals.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) represents one of the most significant technical advances in radiation therapy. By using the inverse treatment planning system and mulitileaf collimator, it allows the clinical implementation of highly conformal dose distributions for target coverage and adjacent normal tissues sparing. However, these advances do not come without a risk. The clinical success or failure of each institution's IMRT program depends on the correct delivery of 3D dose distributions calculated by the planning system to the correct location in the patient. The objective of this study is to establish a dose verification procedure for IMRT planning.\\nMaterials and Methods: A Varian 21EX linac with the 120 leaf multileaf collimator operated in 6 MV and 10 MV x-ray modes using dynamic and step and shoot delivery at 300 MU/min was used for all irradiations. Varian Eclipse planning system (Ver. 7.1) was used also. The procedure was designed for 3 steps. Step 1. Hybridize the patient plan to a solid water phantom using the ”create verification plan” in the Eclipse. Step 2. Recalculate the dose distribution in the phantom. Find area of low dose gradient and select points in this area for point dose verification. 2D dose distribution at isocenter for each portal are calculated for comparison. Step 3. The phantom is then irradiated according to this plan. The point doses are measured using CC01 ion chamber and the 2D dose distributions are measured using Kodak XV film or EDR2 film. Kodak LS75 laser scanner and DoseLab film analysis system are used for 2D dose comparison.\\nResults: The variations of point dose of 124 patients are within 6%. The calculated dose distributions are consistent to the measurements for the 2D dose comparison.\\nConclusions: CC01 chamber is suitable for IMRT point dose verification. Film dosimetry system in this study can be used for IMRT 2D dose distribution comparison. IMRT dose verification can be done by this procedure.\",\n",

This case was proven by pathologic evidence.\\nCase report: This 67 years old male patient was diagnosed of left tongue carcinoma with initial staging of T2N0M0 and received local excision in March 2004 in another hospital. However, left submandibular lymph node recurrence occurred in October 2004. Restaging work-up was arranged and no evidence of distant metastasis was found. Then he received salvage treatment of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) since October 28, 2004. For radiotherapy, the total dose to recurrent LN and primary tumor bed with whole lymphatic chain were 79.8 Gy and 62.4 Gy, respectively. The regimen of chemotherapy was taxotere (12 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (30 mg/m2) weekly for 6 cycles. The total treatment course was completed smoothly on December 24, 2004 except for WHO Grade Ⅱ mucositis that developed during treatment period. Unfortunately, pericardiac effusion occurred as diagnosed by cardiac echography in February 2005. Refractory pericardiac effusion caused cardiac tamponade was still persistent despite of repeated pericardiocentesis. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed that a mass within the right ventricle and massive pericardiac effusion. Surgery was performed owing to progressive degradation of cardiac function on February 24, 2005.\\nResult: The myocardiac tumor biopsy proved metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Unfortunately, this patient died of heart failure even after intensive supportive treatment,\\n12 days after surgery.\\nConclusion: Although primary tongue cancer is frequent in head and neck tumor, metastatic cardiac cancer is a rare occurrence. The diagnosis of metastasis to heart is difficult because of various cardiac symptoms. Most importantly, the diagnosis of cardiac metastasis should be kept in mind if a new onset of cardiac disease occurred in cancer patient.',\n",

In addition, the 3-year OS for patients with long latent period (＞24 months) and short latent period was 81.5% and 33.3% (p＜0.01), respectively. The 3-year OS for patients with and without surgery for recurrent tumor was 63.8% and 25% (p＜0.01), respectively.\\nConclusion: Salvage radiotherapy is effective in achieving satisfactory local control in patients with early stage disease and no lymph node metastasis who developed LRR. For patients with multiple or large recurrent tumors, as well as advanced initial lymph node metastasis, it is imperative to incorporate more aggressive systemic treatment to improve treatment outcome.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To report our institution's experience of radiotherapy (RT) on extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (EPSCCA).\\nMaterials and Methods: Between 1991 and 2004, 21 patients with tissue-proven EPSCCA received RT in our hospital with either curative or palliative intents. Study eligibility required that the patients had pathologically-proven small cell carcinoma in sites other than the lung, a normal chest radiograph and/or computed tomography of the chest, and a normal sputum cytology or negative bronchoscopic findings at diagnosis. The medical records of each patient were reviewed retrospectively and clinical outcomes were compared.\\nResults: Primary sites of EPSCCA in our series included: 7 patients in the gynecological system, 6 in head and neck regions, 3 in urinary bladder, 3 in the gastrointestinal system, 1 in the breast, and 1 in the infra-clavicular soft tissue. Five patients had extended disease (ED) and 16 had limited disease (LD) at initial work-up. RT was delivered to 11 of 16 patients with LD as part of the initial primary therapy, and to 5 with relapse or metastasis as salvage or palliation. The 2-year overall survival for ED and LD EPSCCA were 0% and 49.2%, respectively. During follow-up, a total of 17 (81%) of the 21 patients developed distant metastases. There was a 60% response rate for those patients with ED at diagnosis or LD with relapse or metastasis when RT initiated. For the 11 patients with LD and receiving RT as part of the initial primary therapy, one of six patients receiving surgery followed by adjuvant RT (with or without chemotherapy) developed local recurrence. The remaining five who received RT alone or chemotherapy and RT had a 100% response rate. However, four of them developed local relapses at a median duration of 8 months. The 2-year local relapse-free and disease-free survivals for patients with LD were 53% and 27%, respectively.\\nConclusion: EPSCCA was sensitive to radiotherapy. Easily distant metastasis and local recurrence of the disease warrant more aggressive combination therapy.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: This prospective, longitudinal study was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of using TTS-fentanyl for severe oral mucositis pain induced by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients.\\nMaterials and Methods: Patients diagnosed as HNC and scheduled for concurrent chemoradiotherapy were eligible for this study. TTS-fentanyl was given with the initial dose of 25 μg/h when severe mucositis pain (numeric rating scale [NRS]≧7) occurred in spite of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and topical steroidal ointment use. The pain intensity was assessed every week and if severe pain persisted, another dose of 25 μg/h TTS-fentanyl was given. The adverse effects were recorded every week according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0.\\nResults: From October 2002 to March 2003, 21 male and 1 female receiving CCRT with HNC were recruited to this study. The mean NRS for pain significantly decreased from 7.65±0.99 (baseline) to 3.9±1.29 within the first week. In the fifth week, the NRS raised to 4.79±1.18 but was still lower than the baseline (p=0.003). The sufficient analgesia was achieved in 15 cases with a dose of 25 μg/h, in 5 cases with a dose of 50 μg/h, and in 1 case with a dose of 100 μg/h. One patient withdrew the TTS-fentanyl due to intolerable skin rash and vomiting in the second week. Besides, no one developed respiratory depression, mental clouding, or grade Ⅲ/IV gatrointestinal toxicities.\\nConclusion: TTS-fentanyl is effective and safe in the treatment of mucositis-induced pain which is resistant to NSAID in HNC patients receiving CCRT. TTS-fentanyl also spares the need to swallow pain killers in these patients suffering from odynophagia and/or dysphagia, as well as the time for titration of conventional analgesic drugs. Further larger series with randomized setting is warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TTS-fentanyl for oral mucositis pain.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To discuss the differences of dose distribution between the dual-phase IMRT and one-phase IMRT in the patients of head-and-neck (H&N) cancers with enlarged cervical lymph nodes.\\nMaterials and Methods: From April 2003 to June 2004, we collected 6 patients of H&N cancers with enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Initially, we arranged first simulation by CT-MRI fusion for one-phase IMRT awl prescribed 4500 cGy on GTV including enlarged lymph nodes (Plan A). Five weeks later, we arranged the second simulation by the same method to design dual-phase IMRT and prescribed 2700 cGy on GTV (Plan B). All 6 patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with cisplatin 30 mg/wk intravenously. The IMRT technique was simultaneous intensity boost (SIB). Furthermore, we combined two CT images and superimposed the fluence map of Plan A onto the second CT images to get the Plan C. Finally, we compared Plan B with Plan C.\\nResult: When we compared two CT images, we found that those enlarged lymph nodes already regressed or disappeared after plan A treatment, which made the skin and parotid gland fall into the high dose area. From the comparison of both plans, B had a much better conformal index than C for CTV. Using t test to analyze the D(subscript 50%), D(supbscript 30%) and D(subscript mean) of Plan B and C for the sparing of parotid glands, B had better results than C (p＜0.001). Therefore, the dual-phase IMRT treatment planning can provide another way to significantly decrease the irradiation doses to parotid glands.\\nConclusion This study indicate that if the patient's contour changes without modifying the prior IMRT treatment planning, the doses of parotid glands and the skin will increase and the conformity of dose distribution will decrease, which affect the result of IMRT.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of post-operative hyperfractionated radiation therapy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme in terms of overall survival and prognostic factors.\\nMaterial and Methods: From September 1999 to April 2004, 27 post-operative glioblastoma multiforme patients received hyperfractionated radiation therapy with twice daily fractions of 1.2 Gy at a dose of 72 Gy, except one child who received twice daily 1.08 Gy fraction at a dose of 64.8 Gy. No adjuvant chemotherapy was applied. All patients were irradiated locally after 3-dimensional conformal treatment planning. There were 4 patients who received 2 courses of radiation therapy to the same region of the brain for tumor recurrence, in which the first course was hyperfractionated treatment and the second course were either hyperfractionation or conventional fractionation. Patient and tumor factors were investigated for survival differences using Kaplan-Meier method and Log-Rank test. These include age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Score, tumor maximum diameter, and types of surgery.\\nResults: Median survival of our 27 patients was 12 months, with 1 year and 2-year survival probabilities of 44% and 19%, respectively. The group of patients who received two full courses of radiation treatment did fairly well in survival ranged 12 to 41 months. Patients with Karnofsky Performance Score equal or greater than 70 had longer median survival than patients less than 70 (12 months and 10 months, respectively). This difference is statistically significant (p=0.0443). Although patients younger than 55 years seemed to do better than those older or equal to 55 years (median survival of 13 months versus 11 months), no significant survival difference was noted. Patients who received total resection had better median survival (12 months) than patients who received inadequate resection (7 months), but this difference did not reach statistical significance either. Other tumor or patient factors showed no survival difference.\\nConclusion: The advantage of hyperfractionation radiation treatment is to escalate total tumor dose without increasing toxicity in normal tissues. Total dose of 72 Gy is well tolerated by glioblastoma multiform patients given in hyperfractionated fashion. Overall survival rate and median survival of our patients are comparable to other studies of altered fractionation treatment regime. Karnofsky Performance Score is the most important prognostic factors in our study.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To study the characteristics of two radiographic films and their linearly response ranges.\\nMethods and Materials: Measurement and using the sensitometric curves to analyze the dose performance and recommend the best responsive range for XV and EDR2 films. The parameters of dose rate, field size, depth, and energy of x-ray were applied to evaluate the change in photographic density.\\nResults Comparing the responsive region in sensitometric curves, the slope of XV film is larger than EDR2 film and the saturation dose of XV film is less than EDR2 film. It means responsive range of XV film is smaller than that of EDR2 film. The photographic density was lot changed with the dose rate. As the field size changed from 5×5 to 20×20 cm^2, the variation of four photographic densities was less than 1.5%. The change of photographic density was less than 2.3% within a depth form 5 cm to 20 cm. Replacing the energy of 4 MV with 10 MV, the density increased 8.9% for XV film and 8.2% for EDR2 film.\\nConclusion: We recommend the responsive range of XV film is from 20 to 90 cGy and EDR2 film is from 25 to 400 cGy, at the exposure of 10 MV x-ray. EDR2 film has a better linear relationship between photographic density and dose than XV film. No dose rate effect and a little change ill field size and depth were found. But, the x-ray clergy is an important parameter to the measurement of photographic density.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: In radiographic dosimetry, the performance of the digitizing system is highly dependent on the illumination mechanism or characteristics of light source. Previous analysis of the two types of digitizers by ROC (receiver operator characteristics) method has shown no significant differences. However, ROC method by visual determination is not sensitive for dosimetry purpose.\\nWe evaluated and compared the distinctive features between two digitizers that were purchased in the same particular year (1998's) by the same hospital. They have been routinely used for QA tools and film dosimetry.\\nMaterials and Methods: The duplicate films (Kodak, RA Duplicating Film) were made to be replicas of standard O.D. strip (Kodak photographic step tablet no.3, 21 steps, O.D. range 0.05～3.05) and other test films. Two digitizers were used to digitize those films. One digitizer was the Vidar VXR-12 PLUS with fluorescent light source and the other was Lumiscan-50 with laser beam source.\\nTest films were made in order to investigate their warm-up effect, signal-to-noise ratio, percentage standard deviation, optical density range, transmission artifact and Moiré artifacts. Those features might be affected when films were converted into corresponding value through the above-mentioned digitizers.\\nResults: Varying in O.D. range influence the feature of signal-to-noise ratio, percentage standard deviation, and transmitting capacity that performed by digitizers. The digitizer with a laser beam source was shown more stable in such circumstances. On the other hand, the digitizer with a broadband fluorescent light source had a minor transmission artifact and no Moiré artifacts than the previous one.\\nConclusions: Selection of a digitizer for film dosimetry depends on what kind of data one would want to acquire. A fluorescence light digitizer has a higher spatial resolution and is more suitable for radiation field-light field coincident and star shoot check. On the other hand, a laser beam digitizer offers wilder dose range and less noise.\",\n",

All patients had pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) levels and biopsy Gleason scores (bGSs) Neoadjuvant androgen block treatment was given for less than 6 months. No adjuvant therapy was given after local therapy. 119 patients (50.6%) had undergone radical prostacteomy (RP). 52 patients (22.1%) received EBRT＜70Gy, 38 patients (16.2%) received EBRT≥70Gy, 7 patients (3%) were treated with post TURP radiotherapy and combined interstitial and radiotherapy was delivered for 19 patients (8.1%). Only patients with free surgical margin were enrolled in the group of RP, The median radiation doses in EBRT＜70Gy and EBRT≥70Gy was 65.6Gy and 70.2Gy, respectively. The median follow-up time for all patients was 41.9 months. Biochemical relapse was defined as two consecutive PSA＞0.2ng/ml for RP and three consecutive rising PSA levels (American Society for Therapeutic Radiology Oncology consensus definition) for all other cases. Cox regression multivariate analysis was performed using clinical T stage, bGS, iPSA and treatment modality.\\nResults: The 5-year bRFS (biological relapse free survival) for RP and radiotherapy was 53.5% and 59% respectively. The 7-year bRFS for RP and radiotherapy was 21.3% and 45% respectively. Multivariate analysis showed iPSA (p=0.029) and bGS (p=0.006) to be independent predictors of relapse. Treatment modality and clinical T stage were not independent predictors of relapse.\\nConclusion: There was no significant difference between RP and radiotherapy in the view of biochemical relapse for stage T1-T2 prostate cancer',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Carcinoma of the esophagus is a virulent malignancy with poor survival despite aggression resection. This pilot study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a three-step combination therapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer.\\nMaterial and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with esophageal carcinoma treated at our institution from July 1999 to February 2003. Patients were included in the study if they had T3 to T4, N0/N1, and M0 stage disease. All patients underwent a curative resection with a margin negative for malignant cells. There were i8 patients who then had adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT group) and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy and i8 had surgery followed by radiation alone (RT group). Total doses of 60 Gy for both groups were given. In addition to RT, the CCRT group received concurrent chemotherapy consisting of 6 weekly doses of cisplatin (CDDP) (30 mg/m^2). CCRT was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 monthly cycles of CDDP (20 mg/m^2/day) plus 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m^2/day) for 5 consecutive days. This study looked at survival, toxicity, and patterns of failure.\\nResults: The CCRT group had significantly better median survival (17.5 months vs. 10 months) and 2-year survival (77% vs. 44%, p=0.02). Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were generally comparable in both groups.\\nConclusion: In this preliminary study, we have demonstrated that surgery followed by CCRT improves survival and locoregional control and decreases distant metastasis in local advanced esophageal cancer with acceptable toxicity. A large-scale, prospective randomized trial of this regimen is warranted.',\n",

The median dose was 54 Gy (10-66.6 Gy). Two cycles of 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (1000 mg/m^2/day, continuous infusion, days 1-4 and 29-32) either with mitomycin-C (10-15mg, bolus, day 1) or cisplatin (75mg/m^2, three hour infusion, day 1 and 29) were given concurrently to 30 patients. There were no scheduled breaks for any patients.\\nResults: The median follow-up time was three years (0.1-14.1 years). Of the 33 patients, 82% completed their planned RT doses, and 48% had a RT interruption of more than one week due to severe skin reactions. The median interval for RT was 8 weeks (1-14 weeks). The 3-year actuarial local control (LC), locoregional control (LRC) and permanent colostomy-free survival (CFS) were 71%, 66%, 79%, whereas the 3-year (estimated 5-year) disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were 41% (41%), 77% (72%), 66% (53%) respectively.\\nConclusions: Outcomes at our institution with conventional anal cancer treatment were not outstanding, but were still comparable to other clinical trials. Organ preservation and durable local control can be obtained by concurrent chemoradiotherapy though significant skin toxicity is the major complication interrupting treatment. Innovative RT techniques and chemotherapy regimens certainly warrant further evaluation.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the treatment results and to analyze the prognostic factors affecting the outcome of limited-stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: From January 1997 through September 2003, there were 27 patients diagnosed as limited-stage small cell lung cancer in Changhua Christian Hospital, Taiwan. Among the 27 patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, 22 (82%) were male and 5 (18%) were female. The median age of diagnosis was 61 years. According to the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status scaling system, 3 patients (11%) were ECOG 0, 20 patients (74%) were ECOG 1, and 4 patients (15%) were ECOG 2. The treatments consisted of either concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy regimens were cisplatin and etoposide. The median thoracic irradiation dose was 55.8 Gy (range: 45-64.8 Gy).\\nResults: There were 15 patients (55%) achieving complete response, and 4 patients (15%) having partial response, with a total local response rate of 70%. Only one patient (7%) had local relapse out of 15 patients with complete tumor response. A total of 14 patients achieved local regional control (52%, 14 out of total 27 patients). Thirteen patients (48%) had distant metastasis, and 9 patients (69%) died of their diseases during the follow-up periods. The mean survival time was 28 months. In survival analysis, the 1- year, 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 67%, 54% and 43%, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 68%, 36% and 22%, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 67%, 58% and 46%, respectively. In prognostic factors analysis, cumulative irradiation dose (p=0.018) was a predictor for local response. Body weight loss (p=0.010), cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.007) and local response (p=0.032) were prognostic factors for overall survival. Body weight loss (p=0.037), cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.001) and distant metastasis (p=0.001) were prognostic factors for disease-free survival. Body weight loss (p=0.004), cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.030) and local response (p=0.050) were prognostic factors for disease-specific survival.\\nConclusion: Chemotherapy of cisplatin and etoposide combined with radiotherapy is a feasible treatment modality for patients of limited-stage small cell lung cancer. A local response rate of 70%, and a 2-year overall survival of 54% were achieved. However, distant failure is still the major concern affecting survival in our present study. Among the 15 patients died of their diseases, 9 patients (60%) were dead due to distant metastasis. The modifications of chemotherapy regimens and radiotherapy techniques in further clinical trials are warranted to explore an optimal treatment and to achieve a satisfactory out- come for limited-stage small cell lung cancer.',\n",

The aim of this retrospective study is to analyze clinical outcome of 32 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of maxillary sinus treated by curative intent in a medical center.\\nMaterials and Methods: Chart, radiotherapy data, and CT scan were reviewed in detail. There were 24 males and 8 females. Their age ranged from 33 to 76 (median 63) years old. Most patients (84.4%) presented with T4 disease. Treatment modalities were radical surgery + postoperative radiotherapy (20 cases), radiotherapy with (7 cases) or without (5 cases) chemotherapy. The range of radiation dose was 50-90 Gy with a median of 70 Gy by conventional fractionation.\\nResults: The estimated local control rate at 5 years was 57.0%. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 12.5% and 40.7% respectively. Thirteen of 32 (40.6%) patients developed tumor recurrence or metastasis. The failure pattern illustrated 8 local recurrences, 1 neck metastasis, 1 distant metastasis, 1 local recurrence with distant metastasis, and 2 local recurrences with neck and distant metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and log-rank test showed that age was the most important prognostic factor affecting disease-free survival (P=0.018) and overall survival (P=0.059).\\nConclusion: Our data suggest that primary recurrence is the major site of failure. Except for adequate surgical resection, approaches that can enhance radiation effect (3-D conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy and altered fractionated radiotherapy) and concurrent chemotherapy deserve to be tried in the future.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo simulation on IMRT, the simplified method based on OMEGA/BEAM system was performed in this stud.\\nMaterials and Methods: Instead of modeling the detailed segments of MLC movements, the fluence map provided by the treatment planning system was applied to modify the weights of the phase-space source particles. Therefore, an IMRT portal comprised of several sub-fields could be condensed as a single field in the Monte Carlo simulation. The DOSXYZ code used in this study has bed modified with the capabilities of reading the fluence map file awl adjusting the weights of the phase-space particles correspondingly.\\nResults and Discussion: The simplified method proposed ill this study was verified with the MLC dynamic wedge cases first. The calculated dose profiles of 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-degree MLC dynamic wedge cases show good agreements with the measurements of the profiler and results of the treatment planning system. Furthermore, this method has also bed used to calculate a 5-portal brain tumor IMRT case and the results were compared with the film measurements and treatment planning system. Our results were generally in good agreement with the film and treatment planning system.\\nConclusion: The method of the simplified Monte Carlo simulation on IMRT described ill this study could save a lot of efforts on modeling the detailed segments of MLC movements and shows good agreement with measurements. It would be a good improvement of the efficiency and could be a simple and yet accurate method for applying Monte Carlo methods on the studies corresponding to the influences of IMRT in clinical tasks.',\n",

One hundred and twenty-six patients were enrolled in the study, being malignant brain tumor patients undergoing radiotherapy. Admission was based on a questionnaire that had to be filled ill by the malignant brain tumor patients. This questionnaire had to be filled in twice, the first time ill the first week after starting radiotherapy and the second time within 6 months after completion of the treatment.\\nResults: Seventy-nine patients thought that nutrition would accelerate tumor growth, and 108 patients believed that cancer would lot be contracted through the sharing of food. Ninety-seven patients chose to abstain from certain food after being diagnosed with cancer. Generally more than one type of food was abstained from.\\nConclusion: The patient's confidence in the treatment affected his inclination to turn to alternative treatment during radiotherapy. If alternative treatment was effective, the patients tended to recommend it to other patients.\",\n",
       " 'Optimal treatment for giant cell tumors of the spine remains challenging. Surgical excision remains the initial treatment of choice, but the potential spinal cord injury may limit the extent of resection. Between 2001 and 2003, we report 3 patients diagnosed with giant cell tumor of spine treated with post-operative radiotherapy. Surgery consisted of subtotal resection of tumor. The involved vertebrae were then irradiated with doses ranging from 4500 to 6120 cGy. All patients tolerated the treatment well with no severe or chronic complications. Two of the 3 patients are alive with no evidence of disease. One is alive with recurrent disease upon regular MRI follow-up 24 months after treatment, although it is not clinically apparent. Our experience shown adjuvant radiotherapy after conservative surgery is a reasonable treatment alternative for tumors that cannot be completely excised or in which surgery would result in significant morbidity.

Statistical methods have been employed to analyze overall survival and local-control rates of these cases, and to identify the correlations between different panameters such as the presenting symptoms and signs, surgical findings, radiotherapy (RT) dose, and the RT modality.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between 1985 and 2003, the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, had 228 patients with bile duct cancer referred for RT. Only the 78 patients with no distant organ metastases who underwent treatment for localized biliary system lesions were included in this study. Five patients received intra-luminal RT (ILRT) alone, 15 had external beam RT (EBRT) plus\\nILRT, and 58 patients received EBRT alone. Statistical methods were employed to identify factors that affected overall survival and local-control rates. These factors include patients’ presenting symptoms and signs (jaundice and pain), a past history of hepatobiliary disease, pre-operative performance status (Karnofsky score), surgical findings (lymph node, perineural, and portal vein involvement), histological and pathological classification, CEA level, the radiation modality and the radiation dose.\\nResults : The follow-up periods ranged from 1-160 months (median 17 months). The 78 patients had a 5-year overall survival rate of 11.3% after RT, and the median survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 4.4- 9.9 months). Peri-neural and lymph node involvement, poor performance status, presence of pain and/ or jaundice, poorly differentiated histology, single RT modality and lower radiation doses were factors that correlated negatively with\\nsurvival. The local control rate was most significantly affected by the presence of residual disease prior to RT.\\nConclusion: Higher doses RT offers a better survival to patients with bile duct cancers. The benefit of ILRT given alone remains unclear. Since residual disease appears to be critical for local control, complete resection of the tumor is essential; which reinforces the importance of early diagnosis of bile duct cancer.',\n",

The radiation oncologist should cooperate with doctors of other hospital or department to follow up cancer patients. Other causes of follow-up interruption include economic or family problems, social workers maybe can offer some kind of support for these patients. The on-phone medical education is a useful tool in the follow-up of post treatment patients, but its role should be further evaluated.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : The purpose of this study is to evaluate dose distribution of small and elongated electron beam fields for further reference in arterio-venous fistula treatment. The percent depth dose, isodose curve, and output factor were measured as a function of electron energies and field sizes to provide a practical reference dose system.\\nMaterial and Methods : According to clinical practices , eight field sizes were measured (including 2 ×5, 3 ×5, 4 ×5, 5 ×5, 2 ×10, 3 ×10, 4 ×10, 5 ×10 cm2) and energy of 6, 8, 10 MeV generated by SIEMENS KDS-2 Linac were used in this study. The distance from source to surface (SSD) is 100cm. To generate small and elongated field, the electron blocks were used in our study, and percent depth dose, isodose curves, and output factor were also compared with blocks on electron cone and on phantom surface.\\nResult and Discussion : The percent depth dose, isodose curve, and output factor were measured as a function of electron energies and field sizes. The Dmax shifts towards the surface as the electron beam field size reduced. The smaller the field sizes, the greater the surface dose, and the dose fall-off region becomes more gradual. If the mean size of arterio-venous fistula is 1.5 cm in length and 5mm in width, the safe margin should add 8mm more for long and short axis to cover treatment target adequately. The closer between cerrobend blocks and skin, the better the dose distribution will be.\\nConclusion : The dialysis accesses (arterio-venous fistula) are suitable for electron-beam therapy because of their superficial location. The electron fields for arterio-venous fistula are usually small and elongated, dose distribution are usually unpredictable by conventional calculation table. The study provides a practical reference dose system for small and elongated field size electron beam dose calculation not only for arterio-venous fistula therapy, but also for skin, head and neck area treatment.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Many national and international associations encourage the extension of in vivo dosimetry as an effective tool for an ultimate check of the treatment in external radiotherapy. In vivo dose measurements will be standardized in the QA procedure to avoid minor errors that might cause severe radiation damage. The aim of this study is to establish an in vivo dose verification procedure for head and neck patients and to ensure that they are treated optimally in radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods : To detect and analyze errors that could affect the therapy, we employed well calibrated diodes and thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) for in vivo dosimetry to trace the dose delivery. The detectors were positioned on the patient’s skin and behind the patient. Then, the entrance or exit dose was measured with appropriate correction factors (taking field size, wedge and block into account), and by combining the two dose mentioned above, the dose inside the patient was obtained using transmission curve. In external radiotherapy for head and neck patients where a very accurate dose delivery to the tumor is required, the experimental and prescribed midline dose values were compared.\\nResults : From measurements obtained for external radiotherapy for head and neck patients, 8.96% of the diodes measurements showed a discrepancy more than 5% when compared with prescribed dose, while 43.28% was detected from TLDs. Difference of 10% or more were found in 4.47% of the TLDs measurements.\\nConclusion : In this study we report on our experience with in vivo dosimetry. It shows that systematic in vivo dosimetry is a valid tool for quality assurance. Cancer centers can define an appropriate action level concerning the deviation between measured and prescribed dose; if the action level is exceeded, treatment parameters have to be checked and generally, in vivo dosimetry has to be repeated until the cause of the deviation is found and, if possible, eliminated.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To investigate the long-term treatment outcome of patients of Langerhans cell\\nhistiocytosis (LCH).\\nMaterials and Methods : Twenty patients with the diagnosis of LCH between January 1978 and December 2002 were included in our study. Median age was 12 years. Treatment included surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, combination of multiple modalities and observation. The median follow-up is 87 months.\\nResults : The 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates for all patients were 100% and 92%, respectively. The 5-year progression-free survival rates for patients treated with and without radiotherapy were 100% and 83%, respectively (p = 0.317). The overall local control rate was 87% at five years. Of these, the 5-year local control rates for stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 100%, 100%, 75%, and 50%, respectively (p = 0.695). The 5-year local control rates for patients treated with and without radiotherapy were 75% and 100%, respectively (p= 0.065, despite a good response to local radiotherapy). The 5-year local control rates for age ≤ 25 and ＞ 25 years were 100% and 50%, respectively (p = 0.0007).\\nConclusion : All of our LCH patients had a very high survival regardless of the treatment modalities. This suggests that less aggressive treatments may be the reasonable initial therapy to avoid side effects. The choice of treatment depends on the extent of disease. It seems that multiple bone or neurological involvement did not significantly influence survival. There is no difference in the 5-year local control and survival rates between stage 1 and 2.',\n",

Granulocytic sarcoma (GS), also known as extramedullary myeloblastoma or chloroma is an unusual manifestation and represent soft tissue masses composed of immature cells of the granulocytic series. We reported a case of GS of the uterine cervix. This GS case is unusual because of the disease happened after 12 years of AML remission in a patient considered to have been in remission of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) for twelve years. The recognition of this rare entity is as important as early treatment to improve the prognosis of this dismal disease.',\n",

Herein we reported a breast cancer patient with metaplastic carcinoma which mimicked infiltrating ductal carcinoma in the initial pathological diagnosis. She received modified radical mastectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the chest wall and loco-regional lymphatic area.  Eight months after radiotherapy, a 3 x 2 cm hard mass over the right upper margin of incision was noted. The pathology revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Sequentially multi-organ metastases to the bones, lung and brain developed. The survival period was only 26 months from the diagnosis of breast cancer. The pathology pictures and literature of metaplastic breast carcinoma were reviewed and discussed.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To investigate the prognostic impact of pathologic risk factors and failure patterns in patients with stage IB to IIA cervical carcinoma treated with postoperative adjuvant pelvic irradiation. Material and Method : Between April 1991 to December 2000, 130 patients with FIGO IB to IIA carcinoma of the cervix were treated with radical hysterectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and postoperative radiation therapy. Nineteen patients received systemic chemotherapy. All the patients had at least one of the following pathologic risk factors: 1. positive pelvic nodal metastasis, 2. multiple positive lymph nodes, 3. parametrial invasion, 4. vascular space invasion, 5. positive surgical margin, 6. bulky tumor size ＞ 4 cm, 7. multiple pathologic risk factors. The radiation dose delivered to the whole pelvis range from 41-54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions. One hundred twenty-four patients received 2.5-21.5 Gy intracavitary brachytherapy. Results : The patients were followed for a median of 57.9 months (range: 4.1 - 129.9). The 5-year overall survival and disease free survival rate were 76.5% and 76.1%, respectively. A total of 29 (22.3%) patients developed recurrence. Six recurrences were in the pelvis alone. Sixteen patients recurred only at sites outside the pelvis. Seven patients had both pelvic and distant recurrences. We demonstrated that only vascular space invasion had significant effect on disease free survival by univariate analysis (p = 0.05). Vascular space invasion and multiple pathologic risk factors were significantly correlated with higher incidence of distant metastasis. (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis of these factors showed that only vascular space invasion remained significant risk factors (p = 0.05). Therapeutic complications occurred in 20 (15%) patients, including gastrointestinal in 12 (9%) patients or genitourinary in 8 (6%) patients. The overall 5-year complication-free rate was 91%. Ten (8%) of those patients had grade 3 and 4 late morbidity. Conclusion : Our study suggested that postoperative radiotherapy after radical hysterectomy give reasonable survival in early stage carcinoma of the cervix. Poor survival and higher incidence of distant metastasis were observed if presence of vascular space invasion or multiple pathologic risk factors.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Treatment options for pancreatic cancer remain limited due to the large proportion of patients presenting with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. This retrospective study is to report our result in treating pancreatic cancer with radiotherapy. Material and Methods : From 1992 to June 2002, 32 patients with tissue-proven neoplasms of the pancreas were treated with external-beam radiotherapy to a dose of 45 to 64 Gy (median, 50.4 Gy). Eight patients with resectable tumors received post-operative radiotherapy for margin or node positive. Eight had initial metastatic disease in the liver, lung or neck lymph nodes. The remaining 16 patients had unresectable, locally advanced tumors. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type (28 patients), followed by neuroendocrine tumor (2), cystadenocarcinoma (1) and mucinous carcinoma (1). Chemotherapy with 5-FU or gemcitabine base was given to 28 (88%) patients, most concurrently. Result : The overall survival rate for all patients was 31.3% at 1 year and 10.7% at 2 years. Those with adenocarcinomas had a poorer survival than those with non-adenocarcinomatous tumors (median: 7.6 vs. 22.2 months, P = 0.04). Among the 28 adenocarcinoma patients, survival was significantly better for those with resectable tumors, as compared to unresectable and metastatic tumors (median: 10.9 vs. 8.3 vs. 2.8 months, P = 0.0003). The liver was the most common site of distant metastasis in 11 patients (35%). Conclusion : Despite the relatively favorable prognosis of radiotherapy for resectable compared with unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancers, the survival of patients after radiotherapy is still dismal. New approaches using novel agents and combined treatment modalities are necessary to change the dismal outlook of the disease.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To compare overall survival rate, disease-free survival rate, local recurrence-free survival rate, distant metastasis-free survival rate of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) after curative en-bloc esophagectomy using different doses of radiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC).  Materials and Methods : We conducted a retrospective analysis of 78 patients with pathologically staged LAEC (TxN1, T3-4Nx) with adjuvant CRT after surgery between January 1990 and December 1998. Patients received curative esophagectomy as the primary treatment. Four weeks later, patients received adjuvant CRT at 1.8 Gy/fraction and infusional chemotherapy (1-2 cycles) with regimens of cisplatin 20 mg/m2, fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, leucovorin 90 mg/m2 during radiotherapy. The patients were divided into two groups with the total doses of 40-49.99 Gy (low-dose) for AJCC stage II and over 50 Gy (standard-dose) for stage III.  Results : Twenty-five patients received low-dose radiotherapy and 53 patients received standard-dose radiotherapy. Five-year overall survival rate was 40.00% and 28.30% for the low- and standard- dose group (p = 0.43). Five-year disease-free survival rate was 28.00% (low-dose) and 24.53% (standard-dose) (p = 0.36). Five-year local recurrence-free survival rate was 40.00% and 28.30 % (p = 0.44). Five-year distal metastasis-free survival rate was 38.77% and 24.53 % (p = 0.61). There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups.  Conclusion : The higher radiation dose did not increase survival or local control in LAEC. Low-dose radiotherapy was sufficient whereas standard-dose radiotherapy was controversial for CCRT in LAEC. Randomized trails are recommended to further determine the effects of radiation dose in postoperative chemoradiotherapy in LAEC.',\n",

Herein, we present a 49-year-old female who was a victim of small cell cervical carcinoma with FIGO stage Ib. She initially underwent a radical surgery for tumor removal. Six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy were given thereafter with etoposide and cisplatin. Three years later, a solitary brain metastasis in the left parieto-occipital area was noted in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Craniotomy with metastatic tumor removal was performed. Post-operative whole brain radiotherapy with 46 Gy/23 fractions and a boost of 10 Gy/ 5 fractions to tumor bed were delivered. However, two small recurrent lesions were found in the left occipital horn of the periventricular regions 25 months later. Due to small tumor volumes (total 8 cm3), the new lesion sites were treated by Gamma knife radiosurgery with 16.5 Gy. The follow-up brain MRI disclosed tumor regression but some necrotic change were also noted around the re-irradiated area. She was then put on steroid and symptomatic treatment. By now, she has been alive with no local recurrence or other systemic disease. We think aggressive treatment for solitary brain metastasis from small cell cervical carcinoma can achieve long-term survival.',\n",

The location, the histopathologic and immunohistochemical appearance of the tumor, and the time elapsed since the initial treatment make it probable that this tumor is associated with prior radiation treatment. The possibility of postirradiation sarcoma after radiation therapy should not be a major factor influencing treatment decision in the patient with breast cancer.

       " 'Purpose : To report the experience with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and to determine the factors influencing post-irradiation parotid gland function measured by sialoscintigraphy.  Methods and Materials : This study included 19 patients with NPC treated mainly with IMRT between August 2000 and May 2001. Twelve of these patients had Stage I-II disease and seven had Stage III-IV disease (1997 AJCC). The planning target volume of gross target volume (GTV-PTV), visible lymph node and planning target volume of clinical target volume (CTV-PTV) were designed to receive 70, 65-70 and 55-60 Gy with daily fraction of 2.12, 2.0-2.12 and 1.7-1.8 Gy, respectively. Six patients received 9-18 Gy 3D conformal radiotherapy prior to IMRT. Except from external beam, there were eighteen patients received intracavitary brachytherapy with the dose of 7.0 Gy in two fractions. All Stage II to IV cases except one received two courses of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU during radiotherapy and two to four cycles thereafter. The mean follow-up time was 13.0 months (range: 8-18 months). Objective parotid gland function was assessed by sialoscintigraphy pre-irradiation and at one, three and six months post-irradiation. Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used to determine the factors associated with the changes in post-irradiated secretion ratio (SR).  Results :The mean dose administered to the GTV-PTV and CTV-PTV were 70.9 and 63.2 Gy, respectively. The mean dose administered to the right and left parotid glands was 38.1 and 38.6 Gy, respectively. All of the 19 patients had complete response of primary and lymph node disease at follow-up ranging from 8 to 18 months after radiotherapy (mean, 13 months). Acute side-effects which developed during this concurrent chemo-radiotherapy were RTOG Grade III mucositis in 15 (79%) patients. Clinical xerostomia of Grade I was noted in 9 patients, Grade II in 9, and Grade III in one. There was a significant difference between the pre- and post-irradiation parotid gland SR (p= 0.002). Poor prognostic factors for the preservation of parotid gland function were N (+) Stage (p= 0.03), median dose of parotid gland greater than 35 Gy (p = 0.038), 50% volume of parotid gland greater than 35 Gy (p = 0.032) and the habit of betel quid chewing for longer than 5 years (p = 0.029).  Conclusions :This study demonstrated that the combination of IMRT and chemotherapy is an effective and safe method for the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer. The N stage, median dose of parotid gland, 50% volume dose to the parotid glands and the habit of betel quid chewing were correlated with post-irradiated parotid gland function.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : It has been shown that concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) confers significantly better survival in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) compared with radiotherapy. We conducted a prospective pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a CCRT regimen using low-dose cisplatin (CDDP) for treatment of NPC to see if it enhanced radiation response and reduced chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Materials and Methods : A total of 14 patients were enrolled. The CCRT regimen consisted of radiotherapy (RT), 70~72 Gy to the primary tumor with concurrent CDDP 30 mg/m2 administered once a week for 7 to 8 weekly doses. After CCRT, 4 cycles of adjuvant CDDP, 20 mg/m2/day, and 5-FU, 1000 mg/m2 infused over 24 hours for 5 consecutive days were given monthly. Tumor response and toxicity were analyzed. Results : Eleven patients completed CCRT in 8 to 10 weeks, 3 patients delayed up to eleven weeks, and half (50%) received 4 complete courses of adjuvant chemotherapy. Ten (71.4%) patients had a complete response (CR) after CCRT, with an additional 3 achieving a CR after adjuvant chemotherapy, for a total of 13 (92.9%) out of 14. Adverse effects of CCRT included grade 3 or 4 oropharyngeal mucositis in 3 (21.4%) and grade 3 or 4 radiation dermatitis in 8 (57.1%). There was no severe renal or fatal toxicity from the treatment. At a median follow-up of 19.5 months, 1 patient still had residual tumor, 1 had recurrence and 2 had systemic metastases. Conclusion : CCRT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy was effective in a small series of NPC patients, with acceptable and reversible acute toxicity. This protocol deserves further investigation in randomized prospective trials.',\n",

The aim of our study is to evaluate the outcome and analyze prognostic factors in patients with DCIS of breast treated with partial mastectomy and radiation therapy. Materials and Methods : From December 1992 through July 2003, there were 29 women diagnosed with DCIS of breast receiving the treatment of partial mastectomy and radiation therapy at our institution. The median age of diagnosis was 46 years. The median tumor size was 2.0 cm. The tumor was predominantly at left-side breast (66%), and the outer upper quadrant was the main location (59%). Sentinel axillary lymph node biopsy was performed in 8 patients (28%). The resection margin was free in 14 patients (48%), and positive in 6 patients (21%). The subtypes of pathological report were comedo type in 13 patients (45%), papillary type in 4 patients (14%), cribriform type in 3 patients (10%), solid type in 2 patients (7%), and not specified in 7 patients (24%). Ten patients had high-grade DCIS (35%). Necrosis of tumor was found in 16 patients (55%). The median radiation dose to the breast was 46Gy. The median dose of tumor bed boost was 16Gy. After completion of radiation therapy, hormone therapy with tamoxifen 10mg twice daily was administered to 13 patients (45%). Results : All 29 patients were alive until the latest follow-up. The median duration of follow-up was 25 months (range: 3 to 127 months). Among 28 patients without any regional recurrence or distant metastasis, 11 patients survived for more than 30 months. Only one out of 29 patient (3%) had regional recurrence after follow-up for 4.5 years. Three-year overall survival rate was 100%, and five-year overall survival rate was 100%. Three-year disease free survival rate was 100%, and five-year disease free survival rate was 80%. Three-year disease specific survival rate was 100%, and three-year disease specific survival rate was 100%. Twenty-five patients (86%) had excellent cosmetic results, and 4 patients (14%) had good cosmetic results. In univariate analysis of variables with log rank test, tumor necrosis, tumor grade, and resection margin were significant in predicting disease free survival. Conclusion : The good survival outcome and low local recurrence rate suggested the treatment with partial mastectomy and radiation therapy was a good option of treatment for DCIS of breast. Tumor necrosis, tumor grade, and resection margin were prognostic factors on disease free survival. Larger study series with longer follow-up period should be warranted to make advanced analysis in patients with DCIS receiving treatments of partial mastectomy and radiation therapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Tracheal malignancy was not often seen in clinical practice. Its prevalence was about 0.2-0.5% of all respiratory tract malignancies, with 1:100 ratio of tracheal to bronchial tumors in reported series. Prognosis of patients with tumor of the trachea remains poor. The treatment choice for early stage disease is surgery because extensive resection provides better control. For patients with advanced stage disease definitive radiotherapy has shown modest gain. Several studies have demonstrated the value of radiotherapy in controlling primary tumor in the trachea.  Material and Method : From 1985 to 2000, there were twelve patients with primary tracheal malignancy found in Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Seven patients were squamous cell carcinoma, three were adenoid cystic carcinoma, one was melanoma and one was neuroendocrine carcinoma. Among them, two patients?details were not available anymore. One died of surgical complication within two months after resection. Thus nine of ten evaluable patients entered into the analysis of possible prognostic factors for primary tracheal malignancy. Univariate analyses of prognostic factors were carried out by Kaplan-Meier log rank method.  Results : Seven of ten evaluable patients received definitive radiotherapy as curative purpose and one for palliation. The estimated median survival time for all ten patients was 33 months (CI: 0~66 months), with the survival rate at one and two years being 70% and 60%. Local invasion and duration of initial symptoms were possible significant prognostic factors for poor survival. Besides, we also identified the same factors as the possible significant prognostic factors for disease-free survival time. Local lymph node involvement and histological type of cancer showed effects in both survival and disease-free survival but didn掐 reach the significant level. Conclusion : From our experience, radiotherapy either as a curative or palliative purpose seems to be safe and effective for tracheal cancer. However, due to rarity of primary tracheal malignancy, there was small group in our series. We offered our experience of radiotherapy for tracheal cancer and discuss possible prognostic factors, although less statistic meanings.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Primary CNS lymphoma is a rare disease. Owing to small number of patients and lack of data, large-series studies become difficult. We use a meta-analysis to evaluate the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma and prognostic factor. Materials and Methods : Articles published before September 2003 were searched through PUBMED (National Library of Medicine) and MEDLINE and by the terms of 烢rimary CNS lymphoma? 烋on-Hodgkin掇 lymphoma of CNS? Sixteen potentially suitable articles were found. Among them, four articles matched the selective criteria and were collected into this meta-analysis. There were 85 patient entered the study. The treatment included single and combined modalities of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The variables, such as age, sex, methods of treatment were analyzed about their influence upon initial response and prognosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used. Univariate analysis using the log rank test and multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model were performed. Overall survival and disease-specific survival were calculated with the method of Kaplan and Meier. Results : Forty-one patients (48.2%) were male, and 44 patients (51.8%) were female. The median age was 62 years. Six patients (7.1%) received radiotherapy alone. Thirty-eight patients (44.7%) received chemotherapy alone. Forty-one patients (48.2%) received combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The rate of initial response were 82.4%. During the time of following up, 35 patients (41.2%) were alive, and 50 patients (58.8%) were expired. The 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 47.8% and 28.9%, respectively. The 3-year and 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 49.1% and 34.0%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, age was a significant prognostic factor of overall survival rate (p = 0.0129). Chemotherapy was a significant prognostic factor of overall survival rate and disease-specific survival rate (p = 0.0141, 0.0077 respectively). The number of cycle of chemotherapy was another significant prognostic factor of overall survival rate and disease-specific survival rate (p = 0.0003, 0.0001 respectively). In the multivariate analysis, the number of cycle of chemotherapy is the only significant prognostic factor of overall survival rate and disease-specific survival rate (p = 0.018, 0.007 respectively).  Conclusion : In this study, patients who received chemotherapy with 3 cycles or more had better survival outcome. Chemotherapy with 3 cycles or more is recommended in treatment of primary CNS lymphoma.',\n",

       " 'Soft tissue sarcomas can occur in any site throughout the body and are more frequently found in the limbs, peritoneal cavity and retroperitoneum. Primary central nervous system sarcomas are rare and account for only 1.5% of all intracranial tumors. These tumors are thought to arise from mesenchymal elements within the brain parenchyma or its meningeal coverings. Histopathologically, the most common tumor types included malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, leimyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma. Primary central nervous system fibrosarcomas are usually of high histological grade, with a high rate of recurrence. Their propensity for meningeal and distant relapse distinguishes them from tumors of glial origin. The rare occurrence of primary central nervous system fibrosarcomas leads to a paucity of data in the literature and experience regarding the therapeutic management of these tumors. Because soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive tumors capable of local recurrence and distant metastasis, the need for a multidisciplinary approach is indicated in treating these tumors. As for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity and trunk, the mainstay of treatment of primary central nervous system sarcomas is surgical excision. While brain surgery must be limited due to the proximity of critical structures, en bloc resections cannot be achieved and adjuvant radiotherapy should be given to control residual disease. We report a case of 30-year-old man who had primary central nervous system fibrosarcoma over left frontal lobe with presentation of progressive right-sided numbness and weakness. The patient was treated with total excision of the tumor followed by adjuvant radiotherapy via cone-down wedged-pair technique. Neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis was identified during a follow-up of 1 year. The optimal treatment and prognosis were discussed.',\n",

Case report : This 49 years old male patient is a case of left temporal oligodendroglioma, high grade. He received brain tumor excision and post -operative radiotherapy in 1999. Unfortunately, regional recurrence was found at vermis and cervicomedullar region in 2002. Then he received a course of intraarterial chemotherapy for brain recurrence. At the same time, low back pain with left sciatica was found for 10 months. Then spinal tumor was found and the tissue diagnosis was metastatic oligodendroglioma. Adjuvant radiation therapy to the L2-S3 region was given for 55 Gy/51 fraction 41 days from January, 2003. Result : After completion of radiotherapy, the symptom of low back pain had great improvement. At least 7 months up to recent follow up., this lesion did not show any obvious progression. Conclusion : There were only 8 cases of intracranial oligodendroglioma with spinal cord drop metastasis reported since 1942 to 2002. Base on this case, the compression symptom by tumor could be well controlled by radiation therapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Salivary glands are extremely radiosensitive organs, and are inevitably destroyed during the course of radiotherapy in NPC patients. One of the possible preventive approaches for radiation-induced salivary gland damage is the use of parotid-protecting drugs including pentoxifylline and amifostine. A few other drugs including adrenergic and cholinergic agonists have been tested for their salivary protection effect. The goals for this study are: 1. To establish an animal model using miniature pigs for study of radiation protection of parotid gland. 2. To find out an effective agent for saliva stimulation. 3. To conduct a preliminary study of radiation effect on parotid gland using this animal model.\\nMethods & Materials : Lee-Song species of miniature pigs 3-4 months old weighing about 10-15 kg were used.  They were anaesthetized and intubated followed by salivary collection, drug stimulation, irradiation or surgery.  Drugs including cholinergic stimulant carbachol, adrenergic agonists cyclocytidine and norepinephrine were tested for their efficacy in saliva-stimulation. Electric stimulation was also tested. The entire study structure was as follows: 1. For animal model establishment: anaesthesia procedure, optimization of salivary gland stimulation (physical and chemical approach), optimization of saliva collection.  2. For dose-response study of parotid glands: parotid secretion of unirradiated pigs, right parotid irradiation with 1000 cGy x 2, 300 cGy x 15, and 400 cGy x 12 and assayed for parotid function 1 week, 1 month and 4 months after completion of irradiation. \\nResults : Carbachol 0.2 mg/kg was most efficient for stimulating salivary secretion in a reproducible way. Yet this drug induced cardiac arrest and cardiac massage was needed sometimes. However, this can be reversed immediately after iv bolus of 1 ml of atropine. For saliva collection, using dry, 2 x 2 inch gauze to suck the secretion proves to be accurate and feasible. One week and 1 month after 1000 cGy x 2 the control versus irradiated parotid secretion is 3.0/2.93 ml/min. The difference between control and irradiated glands was also insignificant 1 week and 1 month after 4500 cGy and 4800 cGy.  However, at 4 months, a marked difference in parotid secretion occurred with the control/irradiated of 2.56/1.08 and 6.83/1.99 ml/min, respectively. At 4 months, the irradiated gland was also markedly atrophic and the weight for control/irradiated parotids in 2 experiments was 127.9/26.9 gm after 4500 cGy and and 125.7/22.1 gm after 4800 cGy, respectively.\\nConclusion : Advantages using minipig as the model include the higher similarity with humans than rodents in terms of physiology and anatomy and the much larger salivary secretion volume. The only disadvantage is the higher cost that limits the sample size of the experiment. The animal model we have established is feasible for salivary stimulation and saliva collection that can be reproduced consistently. Carbachol proves to be very efficient for saliva stimulation and cardiac arrest is the only shortcoming. On the contrary, norepinephrine is less efficient for saliva stimulation but is free of the side effect of cardiac arrest. Salivary gland damage appears acutely in humans and persists for many years after completion of radiotherapy. In contrast to humans, minipig parotid gland did not show an evaluable early effect up to 1 month after radiotherapy. The nature of this discrepancy is interesting and requires further exploration. The result of this study may be used for future experiments aiming at prevention of radiation damage to the parotid glands.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common malignancy in Taiwan.  Recently, stereotactic radiotherapy is one of the new treatment modality for this disease.  However, there still do not have study focused on the changes of fatigue level in patients receiving this treatment.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes of fatigue and hematology index in hepatocellular cancer patients receiving stereotactic radiotherapy. \\nMaterials and methods : Prospective longitudinal research design was developed to examine the changes of fatigue and hematology index during and after stereotactic radiotherapy.  Data were collected from December 2001 to May 2002.  A total of 45 eligible subjects were recruited from two teaching hospitals in Taipei. Five patients were excluded due to expire or dropout from this study.  Forty eligible patients finished the seven weeks study.  Fatigues index were evaluated by questionnaire of Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) which measured the fatigue intensity, fatigue duration and fatigue interference weekly. Hb, Ht, WBC and Platelet were measured weekly for 7 weeks.  Besides, AST, ALT and albumin blood index were measured one week before radiation therapy and at week 2, week 4 and week 6 during treatment. Data were analyzed by SPSS computer program. \\nResults : All the subjects in this study had mild fatigue in the beginning of the treatment.  Their fatigue intensity, fatigue duration and fatigue interference were significantly increased from pre-treatment to the 5th week except the 3rd week. The peak level of fatigue occurred in the 5th week and it decreased since the 6th week (p ＜ 0.01).  Blood Hb, Ht, WBC and platelet level descended gradually to abnormal along with treatment (p ＜ 0.05), but the blood AST and ALT level rise along with the treatment.  Though the blood albumin level decreased, it was in normal range. Nonsignificant correlations between fatigue level and laboratory data were found.\\nConclusion : Fatigue was a commonly experienced problem in hepatocellular cancer patients receiving stereotactic radiotherapy, but the fatigue scores were at minimal level.  Part of the hematology study data change during treatment.  The results of this study can provide the clinical personnel information about the change of fatigue level in hepatocellular cancer patients receiving stereotactic radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the response and therapeutic results of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and thalidomide.   \\nMaterials and Methods : From October 1999 to September 2002, thirty-three advanced HCC patients who had been treated with 3D-CRT and thalidomide were reviewed. The mean age was 61.36 years old (range:  36-80 years old). Three-dimensional CRT was delivered at 1.5 Gy per fraction using 6 or 10 MV photons, twice a day and 5 days a week for a total dose of 45- 75 Gy. The mean treatment volume was 369.59 ml (range:  32.54-2094.82 ml). The dosage of thalidomide was 200 mg/day in 25 patients, 300 mg/day in 5 patients, and 400 mg/day in 3 patients.\\nResults : Sixty-four percent [21/33; 1 complete response (CR), 20 partial response (PR)] of patients responded in 淯T field?and 12.1% (4/33; 4 PR) of patients responded in  烋on-irradiated lesion? When therapeutic outcome was determined by the different tumor patterns, the responses of 淯T field?for the recurrent tumor, huge mass, HCC with metastatic lesions and multiple lesions were 80.0% (8/10; 1 CR, 7 PR), 71.4% (5/7; 5 PR), 61.5% (8/13; 8 PR), and 0% (0/3; 2 SD and 1 PD), respectively (p = 0.234). Furthermore, the responses of 烋on-irradiated lesion?for the recurrent tumor, huge mass, HCC with metastatic lesions and multiple lesions were 10.0% (1/10; 1 PR), 14.3% (1/7; 1 PR), 15.4% (2/13; 2 PR), and 0% (0/3; all 3 PD), respectively (p = 0.778). The mean and median survival times were 327 and 242 days, respectively. The adverse effects of 3D-CRT and thalidomide include constipation (26/33, 78.8%), drowsiness and sedation (15/33, 45.5%), skin rash (11/33, 33.3%), lower extremity edema (20/33, 60.6%), peripheral neuropathy (2/33, 6.1%), dizziness (1/33, 3.0%), orthostatic hypotension (1/33, 3.0%), leukopenia (5/33, 15.2%), transient elevation in liver function tests (9/33, 27.3%), and epigastralgia (8/33, 24.2%).\\nConclusions : Our experience concluded that 3D-CRT combined with thalidomide might be a safe and effective treatment modality for unresectable HCC patients. The preliminary data showed quite promising result. It is valuable to study the potential role of 3D-CRT combined with thalidomide in the treatment strategy for HCC at various stages.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To evaluate treatment outcomes in patients under 40 years of age with cancer of the mobile tongue.\\nMethod and Materials : Between January 1990 and September 1999, 35 patients under 40 years of age suffering from mobile tongue cancers were treated at the LinKou Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (LK-CGMH). External beam radiotherapy was used as either adjuvant management after surgery or primary treatment. All patients were followed for at least three years or until death. Median follow-up was 1.35 years.\\nExternal radiotherapy of at least 60 Gy was administered to all patients. Twenty-eight patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. Six people who refused or were unsuitable for surgery were treated with radiotherapy only. One patient underwent radiotherapy as primary therapy but required surgical salvage after recurrence. The treatment results were analyzed, as were pre-treatment habits, tumor staging, and treatment modalities.\\nResults : The three-year overall survival and disease-specific survival rates for the group were 42.8%, and 48.2%, respectively. After excluding patients who chose not to undergo surgery as primary treatment, the rates were 50% and 57.6%. The median survival of all patients and patients who received primary surgery was 1.42 and 3.26 years, respectively. In all patients who did not undergo surgery as primary treatment, tongue tumor control was not achieved, and all died within 16 months, except for one who experienced complete remission after induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemo-radiation. Univariate analysis indicated that primary surgery, 1997 AJCC staging group III or IV and histological differentiation significantly affected overall survival. Multivariate analysis found that poor histological differentiation was the only significant factor affecting overall survival.\\nConclusions : These findings concur with those of other series for the age group studied. Surgery continues to be the first-line, primary treatment for patients under 40 years of age with cancer of the mobile tongue.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Carcinoma of the esophagus is a virulent malignancy often diagnosed in its late stage. Despite aggressive surgical resection, the overall 5-year survival reported is poor. Several researchers have investigated the use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the management of esophageal cancer and demonstrated a significant survival improvement. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of an outpatient CCRT regimen using weekly cisplatin as a radiosensitizer. \\nMaterials and Methods : We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with esophageal carcinoma treated at our institution from July 1999 to February 2003. Patients were included in the study if they had T3 to T4, N0, and M0 stage disease. There were sixteen patients enrolled into definite concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy group whereas eleven patients into radiation alone (RT) group. RT for both groups was delivered with total dose of 60 Gy. In addition to RT, the CCRT group received concurrent chemotherapy consisting of 6 weekly doses of CDDP (30 mg/m2). CCRT was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 monthly cycles of CDDP (20 mg/m2/day) plus 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/day) for 5 consecutive days. This study looked at survival, treatment response, toxicity and pattern of failure in enrolled patients.\\nResults : A total of 27 patients fulfilled the study criteria. The most frequent symptom, present in over 90%, was progressive dysphagia. During therapy, 88% (14/16) of patients on CCRT and 81% (9/11) receiving RT had symptom relief. There are significant differences between the two groups (CCRT vs. RT) in terms of median survival (15 months vs. 5 months), 2-year survival (57% vs. 18%, p = 0.003) and local regional failure rate (43% vs. 100%, p = 0.003). Both the hematological and non-hematological toxicities developed in the two groups are generally comparable and acceptable. \\nConclusion : In this preliminary study, we have demonstrated that a weekly outpatient CCRT regimen using low-dose cisplatin, followed by 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU, improves survival and locoregional control of locally advanced esophageal cancer with acceptable toxicity. Large-scale, prospective randomized trials of this regimen are warranted.',\n",
       " 'It continues to be debated whether melanins are photoprotecting or photosensitizing in human skin cells. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that dark-skinned people are much less susceptible than Caucasians to ultraviolet (UV)-induced skin damage including both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer. On the other hand, melanin, its intermediates and precursors can generate reactive-oxygen species when irradiated with UV irradiation and have been shown to be effective photosensitizers. \\nThe last decade has witnessed a renewed and unprecedented impetus in melanin research that has significantly expanded our knowledge of this field. Melanin is a highly irregular heteropolymer consisting of monomeric units derived from the enzymatic oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine. There are two distinct types of melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin. Now, it is proved that eumelanins are the main photoprotective pigment in the epidermis and pheomelanins are phototoxic upon irradiation. \\nThe same situation is also true for ionizing radiation that eumelanin not only possesses radiation protective effect but also contains photoprotective ability. Since malignant melanoma is resistant to radiation therapy, therapeutic strategies targeted to the melanogenesis of eumelanin may have potential benefit for the radiation therapy of malignant melanoma.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : Electron beam radiation therapy is one of the most potential treatment modality for treatment of superficial tumor. As the electron energy used in the treatment is chosen based on the depth, the underlying normal tissues can be spared more compared to photon beam therapy. Furthermore, electron beam has become frequently employed in total body irradiation to boost chest wall for treatment of bone marrow transplant, leukemia. Hence, radiation therapy using electron beams have shown increasing important role and applications in clinical use. \\nMaterials and Methods : In this study, the effective SSD of different electron energies at various depths were investigated using linear accelerator, parallel plate ion chamber, electrometer and solid water phantom. The dosimetric properties of different electron cones and energies were measured at surface, and maximum, 90%, 80%, 50% dose depth. The dosimetric variations and applications under varied energies and output period were then discussed. \\nResults : The results showed that: the larger the electron cone size and energy, the larger the electron effective SSD. The results of effective SSD measured at maximum, 90%, 80% dose depth showed negligible difference within 2%. The effective SSD measured at surface and 50% dose depth showed a larger difference about +5.04%.\\nConclusions : In general, the central beam axis dose correction for the electron effective SSD applied with inverse square law uses the maximum depth as reference point. In this study, the measurements at different percentage depth dose point were tabulated to clearly state the dosimetry characteristics of electron beams and improve understanding of the dosimetric distributions, thus perfecting the patient treatment plans.',\n",

The affecting factors for dose optimization is this study include: diameter of vaginal cylinder, source positions and optimized dose points.\\nResults : Vaginal applicator with smaller diameter (1.5 cm) has a higher average surface dose (173.6 cGy vs. 127.3 cGy) and a more inhomogeneous dose distribution (standard deviation 31.8 cGy vs. 11.7 cGy) than a larger one (3.5 cm). When the interval of optimized dose points was increasing to 10 mm, the dose at surface apex point increased 28% with the larger diameter applicator. Increasing interval of source dwelling positions resulted in a rise of dose at apex point. There was a 70% dose enhancement at off-surface dose point when optimized dose points were re-arranged.\\nConclusions : When utilizing single-channeled applicator for vaginal brachytherapy, a cylinder with larger diameter will result in more homogenous dose distribution.',\n",
       " 'Meningeal hemangiopericytoma is a rare tumor in central nervous system (CNS), consisting of less than one percent in incidence. It has distinctive characteristics of being slow in tumor progression and high in tumor recurrence. Unlike other CNS tumor, there exists also risk of neuroaxis and distant metastasis. Due to repeated recurrence, the presented case had received two full courses of irradiation to tumor bed with an interval of five years. The cumulative dose in the overlapped region of brain is greater than 100Gy, overt brain necrosis developed with progressive neurologic symptoms at seven months after second radiotherapy. After surgical decompression and removal of necrotic mass, the patient is still alive at present with improved neurologic symptoms. As a matter of fact, this patient has been alive for over 14 years since the first time that she found out about her brain tumor. After review of papers, we conclude that radiation induced brain necrosis may be expected in reirradiation, but not every case reirradiated results in brain necrosis with clinically severe neurologic deficit or mortality. If there is survival benefit and/or symptomatic improvement, reirradiation in the CNS may be considered in selected case.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : To report the results of salvage treatment of recurrent nasopharyngeal cancers (NPC) using Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GK) alone or combined with conventional radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and methods : From 1993 to 1997, eleven patients (6 males and 5 females) were diagnosed to have recurrent tumors over the primary site of nasopharynx and/or skull base at our hospital after initial radiotherapy. The time interval between the primary radiotherapy and salvage GK was 1 to 12 years (median = 2.0 years). All patients received single fraction of Gamma Knife radiosurgery was performed with peripheral doses of 12.5 to 20 Gy (median = 15 Gy) to cover the recurrent tumor as conformal as possible. The tumor volumes (TV) were less than 1 to 33 cc (median = 11cc) whereas radiation volumes (RV) were 6 to 48 cc (median = 20.9 cc). Retrospectively the patients were divided into two groups according to their treatment. Four patients received GK without further radiotherapy (Group A). The other 7 patients received hyperfractionated external beam radiotherapy of 30 to 47 Gy (median = 38 Gy) and concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-FU, mitomycin C) for further boost of the tumor (Group B).\\nResult : All patients tolerated GK well without significant acute toxicity. The first MRI after GK showed tumor regression for eight out of nine patients receiving this examination. One patient died of sepsis induced by concurrent chemotherapy, not receiving fractionated RT. For the other 3 patients receiving GK without combined RT (group A), 2 tumors recurred 7 and 15 months later and one patient lost to image follow-up and expired within 6 months after GK. Five out of seven patients of group B remained local control at the last image follow-up (6 to 62 months after GK). However, three patients of this group of had prominent brain damage shown by MRI and PET scan after salvage irradiation. The median survival of all our patients is 48.8 months. The five-year survival rate is 36.4%.\\nConclusion : Combined fractionated RT, GK radiosurgery and concurrent chemotherapy seem to achieve better local control for intracranially recurrent NPC than GK alone. It is not recommended to use single-fraction radiosurgery to salvage a newly diagnosed skull base recurrent NPC. Bilateral opposing fields in fractionated RT should be avoided to lower the incidence of late complications.',\n",

Health- related quality of life was assessed 3 months or later after the completion of the treatment by means of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ C-30) and the EORTC head and neck cancer-specific questionnaire (QLQ H&N-35). \\nResults : Pain (r = -0.194***), weight loss (r = -0.165**), dry mouth (r = -0.155**), sexuality (r = \\n-0.138*), sticky saliva (r = -0.130*), social eating (r = -0.108*), gain weight (r = 0.107*) and problem of open mouth (r = 0.105*) revealed significance with changes over time by simple correlation analysis. In order to understand the effects of non-linear simple correlation, the periods between completion of radiotherapy and patients filling in the questionnaire were divided to 4 groups: 3-6 months, 6-12 months, 1-5 years and more than 5 years. All items but three (problem of open mouth, administration of painkiller and gain weight) showed statistical significance by one-way ANOVA analysis. Hence, all items and symptoms changing over time were divided into four types: increasing, decreasing, U type, and W wave type. \\nConclusions : Our study suggest that detailed information about the changes over time may help us in communication with patients and in design of intervention studies focusing on improvement of the supportive care and rehabilitation of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose : to evaluate factors related to tabooed foods in cancer patients and to study the motivation and concept of tabooed foods from patients?view point so that patients may accept correct knowledge about diet control and nutritional support via a positive communication skill.\\nMaterials and Methods : From November of 1997 to October of 1999, data from 872 irradiated cancer patients were collected at Dept. of Radiation Oncology, Lin-Kou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Patients were requested to answer a series of questions from well-designed questionnaire. This was done twice , namely, first week at the beginning and 6 months after the entire course of radiotherapy.\\nResults : prior to cancer attack, 24 cases (2.8%) had no tabooed food while 651 cases (74.7%) had this taboo after experiencing malignancy. Tabooed food were usually of several kinds. Of these, 325 cases (37.3%) considered that nutritional supplements may help the growing of tumor masses while 140 cases (16.1%) suspected that cancer is communicable via taking food together with one another. From patients unable to prove a statistically significant correlation between a special subset of patients and the development of above-mentioned misconcepts toward the effect of certain food intake on the growing of malignant tumors (p ＞ 0.05). However, patients with age above 60 year old regarded that meats were toxic to normal human body and related to cancer development (p ＜ 0.05).\\nDiscussion : During radiotherapy, each patient received nutrition education from dietitian and nursing staff concerning balanced diets. Yet, patients may still adopt their own view point of diet control. The chance for a curative attempt of management may be compromised provided that patients failed to receive adequate nutritional support during radiotherapy which may cause loss of body weight, impairment of general immunity or toxicity related interruption of treatment. Health professionals should, therefore, try their best to offer patients accurate knowledge of nutrition and to clarify the inappropriate taboos of foods.',\n",
       " 'A wedged-pair setup of two cross-fired radiation fields is a common practice in radiation therapy to achieve a homogeneous dose distribution over the irradiation volume.     It is a simple way to keep the radiation dose to the distal normal tissue below one half of the tumor dose.  The optimum wedge angle depends on the hinge angle between the wedged-pair fields.  The hinge angle can be easily determined in conventional 2D radiation planning, because the two wedged-pair fields are usually coplanar with treatment couch set at 0? 90?or 270?  In non-coplanar 3D radiation planning, hinge angle is difficult to be calculated.  In addition, the wedge orientations are most likely not opposed to one another.  An accurate mathematics formula to align two wedged-pair fields into coplanar orientation in 3D space is derived and implemented into a computer program.  The optimization program requires only two parameters, gantry angle and couch angle, for each of the wedged-pair fields.  It calculates the collimator angles of the wedged-pair fields and aligns the wedge direction and the isocenter on a single plane.  It also calculates the hinge angle of the wedged-pair fields and suggests a wedge angle for optimal dose distribution.  Through the reduction of the try-and-error optimization of collimator angle/wedge angle setting, this program increases the efficiency and throughput of an interactive 3D radiation therapy planning.',\n",

       " 'Purpose : To evaluate the accuracy of dose calculation in lung cancer treatment planning using Two-dimensional radiotherapy (2D-RT) without inhomogeneity correction, with inhomogeneity correction by use of Power Law Tissue-Air Ratio Method (Power Law Method), and Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) with inhomogeneity correction. The latter method takes into account in convolution algorithm. \\nMaterials and Methods : Treatment was planned based on Alderson-Rando phantom held in an immobilization device. Doses were calculated on FOCUS release 2.0 planning system both for 2D-RT and 3D-CRT, and irradiation were performed on Varian C-Series 600C linear accelerator, 6MV x-ray. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were placed inside the target to compare the dose based on each method. The prescribed dose was180 cGy in isocenter.\\nResults : The delivered doses by using 3D-CRT planning and 2D with Power Law Method correction were closer to the prescribed dose (173 cGy, 172 cGy in a 5 x 5 cm2 field and 175 cGy, 174 cGy in a 10 x 10 cm2 field). The delivered dose by using 2D-RT planning without heterogeneity correction was significantly higher (212 cGy and 216 cGy). \\nConclusion : Dose variation between measurement and calculation is due to tissue inhomogenity, especially in the lung. Power Law Method accounts with tissue inhomogeneity but not with the 3D shape of inhomogeneity tissue. 3-D treatment planning with inhomogeneity correction based on CT image, delivers more accurate dose. Use of 3-D planning in lung cancer should reduce the risk of radiation side effects while optimizing delivery to the tumor.',\n",

The distance from block surface to tray (BSTD) is 10, 15 and 25 cm for the blocks. High energy photon beams of 6 and 10 MV generated by SIEMENS KDS-2 Linac were used in this study. Asymmetric field with equivalent field size of 10 ?10 cm2 was used for all the measurements. Peripheral doses were measured by using a Farmer type chamber and Acrylic solid phantom. Ionization charges were collected by a Victoreen 500 electrometer. PD for different depth, BSTD, and block thickness were evaluated. Nucletron water phantom system with 0.12 c.c. R K chamber was used for measuring the variations of PD with distances from field edge and depth. PD with and without block were measured also. \\nResult and Discussion : We find that block with BSTD equal to 25 cm decrease the PD most. When distance from field edge is 5 cm and depth at 5 cm, the PD relative to Dmax (dose at dmax) at central axis is 1.74% without block, and is 0.86% with block for 6 MV. The block with thickness of 15 cm has the best attenuation effect, and reduce the PD to 0.45% relative to Dmax . The PD decreases as the distance from field edge increases. Close to the field edge, the PD drops initially with depth, the minimum apperance at the depth that deeper than the dmax (depth of maximum dose) of the central ray 0.5 cm. Behind the dmax, the PD increases gradually with depth and then become nearly constant farther. The qualitative behavior of the PD is similar for 6 and 10 MV.\\nConclussion : From the results, we know that the blocks have obvious contribution for reducing the PD, and that advantage is used conviently, made easily, low cost, but shortcoming is just suitable for small treatment field. To improve the equipment for better is our object in the future.',\n",

At the end of study, local recurrent or persistent tumors were determined for 94 patients (68%). Forty-nine patients (35.5%)subsequently developed distant metastases. The causes of death were: locoregional disease: 56% (n=77),distant metastasis:27.5%(n=38), cachexia:11% (n=15), cerebrovascular accident:0.7% (n=1). Bone. Liver and lung were the most common metastatic sites. Most of the patients died within two years after interruption of treatment. Death was the only outcome evaluated. Less than 5% patients (n=5) were alive without disease till the time of analysis. \\nDiscussion: The prognosis has been dismal for undertreated NPC patients. Our study confirmed that long-term survival is rare in patients with NPC receiving EBRT doses not more than 4500 cGy. The majority of patients died within 2 years after interruption of radiotherapy (RT). The acute side effects and complications of RT were the primary factors influencing the patient’s decisions to drop out of the treatment.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)with portal vein tumor thrombosis(PVTT)has poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and prognostic factors of conformal radiotherapy for PVTT in unresectable HCC. The primary endpoint of this study is the overall survival of patients. The secondary endpoint is the overall response of tumors. \\nPatients and Methods: form June 1998 to December 2001, 23 patients of advanced HCC with PVTT enrolled into the study. Mean treatment dose was 47.6 ±4.4 Gy, in a daily fraction of 1.8-2.2 Gy. Response was assessed by enhanced computer tomography (CT) scan and/or color Doppler abdominal ultrasonography 2-4 weeks following completion of the treatment and then in a 2-4 month interval. Survival was calculated from the diagnosis of PVTT using the Kaplan-Meier method. \\nResults: An objective response was observed in 9 patients, giving a response rate of 39%. The survival rate of the responder patients was significant higher than non-responders(median survival 13 vs. 5 months, p=0.0027). All of the 9 responders received sub-sequent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI). Multivariate analysis showed that the response of PVTT and the subsequent treatments were the prognostic factors of the survival, while the pre-treatment hemoglobin and serum albumin level were the factors that affected response. The intervals from the completion of radiotherapy to response ranged from 10 to 255 days(median 17 days).\\nConclusion: Local conformal irradiation to PVTT is sometimes feasible and effective. Better nutritional status reflected by the hemoglobin and serum albumin levels improves response rates and prolongs survival consequent to subsequent TACE or PEI.',\n",

Wide local excision is the recommended treatment, although this may not always be feasible. Wu report out experience in treating EMPD of the vulva by radiotherapy in two patients.\\nCases: Two 81-year-old women with EMPD in the vulvar region were treated using appositional electrons mixed with photon beams. One patient received 40 Gy in 20 fractions (patient 1), and the other one received 50 Gy in 25 fractions (patient 2).Both patients developed local swelling, focal moist desquamation, erythema and pain during the treatment course, but were tolerated well. Complete regression of EMPD was observed in both patients and neither local recurrences nor internal malignancies have been documented. Patient 1 developed new lesions over peri-anal region 10 months afterwards and was irradiated for another 50 Gy in 25 fractions with good local control. She was followed up for another 5 months with no evidence of disease. Patient 2 was followed up for 12 months without recurrence.\\nConclusion: Radiation therapy potentially could be a curative treatment in selected cases of EMPD disease affecting large areas of the vulva region or elderly and clinically inoperable patients.',\n",
       " 'A 15 year-old boy was sent to our Neurologic Department because of severe headache and sudden onset of right hemiparesis. Neurologic exarmination showed motor dysfunction of right upper limb, bilateral temporal visual field deficits and impaired visual acuity. Computer tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass lesion in the left basal ganglion region. He received craniotomy for partial resection of the tumor and the nature of the tumor was proved to be germinoma, histologically. He was then treated by radiotherapy with a mean dose of 21 Gy to the whole brain and an additional boosting dose of 20 Gy to the tumor bed by three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. There was an elevation in the serum concentration of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-HCG) and alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) after the operation which suggested the possibility of other germ cell components in the tumor. However, the response of radiotherapy was good. No acute radiation toxicity was noted during irradiation and the muscle power of his right arm improved after follow-up for one year until the present. Long-term follow-up and further clinical studies are needed to determine the benefit of this moderate dose radiotherapy.',\n",

Taipei, Taiwan. One 83-year-old patient was excluded for the grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity and incomplete RT. The median dose to whole pelvis or seminal vesicle/prostate was 46 Gy in a daily fraction of 1.8-2.0 Gy. The median dose to the prostate was 70 Gy. The neoadjuvant hormone therapy was given to 49 patients, usually starting 1-3 months before the initial date of RT. The survival outcome was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, The analysis of prognostic factors on survival was calculated by Log-ran k test. \\nResults: The median follow-up interval of 66 patients was 36 months. The univariate analysis of overall survival, disease-free survival and biochemical failure-free survival showed only Gleason score with statistical significance. The 3-year overall survival, disease-free survival and biochemical failure-free survival were 97 % and 55%, 97 % and 27%, and 97 % and 35% in patients with Gleason Score ＜ 8 and Gleason Score≧8, respectively (p＜0.0001 for each  comparison).

Our out-come of patients who received RT and neoadjuvant hormone therapy indicated the acceptable quality of care in our department The lager series with long-term follow-up is needed to further delineate the prognostic factors and confirmed outcome.',\n",
       " \"”Purpose: Many head and neck cancer patients suffer from xerostomia after irradiation. General treatments such as saliva substitutes, antimicrobial rinses and fluoride application do not provide a satisfactory result. Some current studies showed that oral pilocarpine improves the condition of xerostomia in these patients, We designed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this drug in our hospital. \\nMaterials and Methods : The were 48 patients in this study divided equally into study or control cohort by a randomized way. All of them underwent more than 40 Gray of radiation and stopped the treatment, including radiation and chemotherapy, two months before getting into this study, Patients were administer Pilocarpine 5 mg three times a day for 12 weeks and weeks evaluated for overall condition, oral dryness, mouth and tongue comfort, speaking without fluid, the need for oral comfort agent, chewing and swallowing, and the ability to sleep, by visual analog scale questionnaire, The safety was evaluated by examining adverse events and laboratory results. Data were compared using Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel's test and analysis of variance.  Results: Twenty-five patients completed the experiment in this study, including eleven persons in the study group. We collected the data in the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks after administration of drug to evaluate the efficacy of pilocarpine. The data showed that both groups got improvement in xerostomia (18.2 ~63.6% ) though it only showed the statiscally significant difference in the component of ability to sleep (p= 0.026). There was no statistical difference in adverse events between the two groups, except increased sweating and urinary frequency in study group. \\nConclusion: Oral pilocarpine may be effective to treat radiation induced xerostomia in some head and neck cancer patients, especially to improve the ability to sleep, and it is also a safe drug for these patients. The results are limited for interpretation due to few numbers of patients in both arms and half patients excluded from the study with incomplete treatment.

Three of them had locally advanced unresectable rectal cancer and 12 patients had low-lying rectal cancer (within 6 cm from the anal verge). Patients' age ranged from 27 to 73 years (median, 48). Pretreatment tumor stages, determined by the CT scan, included 2 with T2NO, 10 with T3NO, 1 with T3N1, and 2 with T4NO. The preoperative treatment procedure consisted of convention-ally fractionated irradiation of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the pelvis with concomitant 5FU-based chemotherapy 6-8 weeks before surgery. \\nResults: Tumor down-staging was pathologically confirmed in 10 (67%) of 15 patients, including 3 with complete response (CR), 1 T1 NO, 4 T2NO, and 2 T3NO disease. Sphincter preservation was accomplished in 8 (67%) of 12 of low rectal cancer patients. The surgical procedures included proctectomy and coloanal anastomosis (n = 7), lowanterior resection (n = 4), and abdominoperineal resection (n = 4) All patients tolerated the combined chemoradiotherapy approach well without grade 3 or 4 toxicity.

       " \"”Purpose: To improve the reproducibility of irradiated volume in treating rectal cancer patients with fractionations, we have developed a new isocenter determination method and tested its accuracy by comparison of portal and simulation films. \\nMaterials and Methods : Patients were placed in the supine position with only a head restraint and feet immobilizer, During Computerized Tomography (CT), the isocenter was fixed at 7cm from the bed surface in the direction of the abdomen, after which the position was marked on the patient's body by means of laser projection. A rubber tube was attached for visualization on x-ray films. The isocenter was thus indicated on the CT scan. During the first treatment, a portal film was made for comparison with the simulation film, and displacement and rotation errors of the two were measured. Results: Mean head-to-toe displacement was 1.3±3.3 mm, left-right displacement was 1.9 ±3.8 mm and anteroposterior displacement was 0.2± 2.0 mm. The man coronal rotation was 0.76±2.84°, sagittal rotation was 0.52±0.76° and transverse rotation was 0.04±0.33°. \\nConclusion: Stabilizing the position of the pelvis on the treatment couch is a reliable method for treatment. Displacement in almost all directions was less than 5mm. The error for coronal rotation was slightly greater, but nonetheless within acceptable range. Therefore, this type of treatment localization method is a simple and reliable method.”\",\n",

One of the characteristics of TG-51 is being based on the use of the ion chambers calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water in a 60Co beam. The calibration factors of are defined as N. The other is that the parameters needed for dose calculation are much more simplified than in TO-21 The conversion factor for beam quality of photon in TG-51 is kQ, for electron are P, k'R50'k, k.The purpose of this paper is to development complete TG-51 dose calculation program to decrease the errors arising from looking up tables and doing calculations. \\nMaterials and Methods: We use Visual Basic 6.0 produced by Microsoft to develop a does calculation program of TG-15.

A neural-network is employed to relate the actual dose and energy spectra. After calibration and training, the optical densities of the four films can be input to the network to yield the actual dose at any location. \\nResults: The PDD of a 20 x 20 field size and the dose distribution of an off-axis location at 5cm are estimated using this trained neural network. The maximum differences between the measurements of this film system and ionization chamber were less than ±4%, and less than 2% for the mean error in our investigation. \\nConclusion: Optical density and dose relationship can be found and converted by our neural-net system. For the future studies, we will focus on clinical application of these experimental results and extend the concept to multiple beam orientations.”\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: New advances in radiotherapy technology enable us to attain higher dose delivery to tumor region, resulting in greater tumor control probability, with this sophistication there is more demand to control the uncertainties contributed by organ motion. The organ motion related uncertainties can be mainly classified into three main categories: (I) the blurring of planning images due to internal organ motion during CT scan acquisition; (II) intrafractional organ motion that affect the dose distribution within a single treatment delivery; (III) interfractional organ motion that affect the dose distribution between treatments. For patients with supradiagphragmatic and infradiagphragmatic tumor, respiration is a major factor that causes the displacement of the internal organ. For further under standing the magnitude of the respiratory organ motion, we endeavor to investigate: (I) the geometrical differences in spatial displacement of the tumor and critical organ while in free breathing status and breath holding status; (II) measures the magnitude of the respiratory organ motion in the cranio-caudal direction; (III) makes a preliminary feasibility study of the coaching breathing technique to improve the reproducibility of the respiratory cycle and hence reduce the variation of organ motion in between treatment. Results and Methods: The data were collected between March 2001 to October 2001in our department from subjects undergoing radiation therapy of the thoracic and abdominal regions using our spiral CT and real time Respiratory Gating system to measure and analyze the variation of respiratory organ motion. A voice coaching technique is designed to improve the consistency of the respiration cycles. Results and Conclusions: Our analysis shows a significant variation of tumor and organ geometry between free breathing and breath holding state. The cranio-caudal displacement are 15.5±3.5 mm for diaphragm and 13.7±2.4 mm for pancreas, respectively. For patients in our study, coaching technique may improve the reproducibility for those patient whose breathing cycles is not consistent within intrafraction treatment, but not for those with consistent cycles.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the effect of post-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and to determine the prognostic factors in esophageal cancer. \\nMaterials and Methods: From October 1991 to November 2000, fifty-six patients with esophageal cancer received post-operative radiotherapy at VGH-KS. Twenty-three patients were treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone at 50 Gy and others underwent RT combined with chemotherapy (C/T) consisting of cisplatin plus 5-flurouracil (5-FU). There was no significant difference in patient characteristics between two groups, except in tumor length. We compared overall, disease-free, loco-regional-free and distant-metastasis-free survival rates between two groups. We also analyzed various prognostic factors including age, tumor length, tumor stage, status of surgical margin, lymph node (LN) metastasis, vascular or neural invasion, and the time interval between operation and radiotherapy.\\nResults: The median follow-up time was 16 months. For all patients, the overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 20.2%, and the disease-free survival (DFS) was 19.1 %. Loco regional failure occurred in 14.3% of patients and 35.7% of patients developed distant metastasis. The 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 42.7% and 23.7% for RT group and 41.0% and 16.0% for CCRT group. There was no significant difference in as and DFS between two groups (p= 0.694 and 0.875). In lymph node metastatic patients, overall and disease-free survivals of CCRT group were not superior to those of RT group (p= 0.273 and 0.486). In CCRT group, there was also no significant difference in as and DFS between the patients receiving less than 3 cycles of C/T and those receiving more (p= 0.968 and 0.406, respectively). By the uni-variate analysis, we found that neural invasion, numbers of LN metastases and involved LN levels, and the percentage of positive dissected LN affected the survival rates. The only prognostic factor of survivals in the multi-variate analysis was the involvement of more than one LN level. \\nConclusion: Based on our analysis, post-operative combination therapy is no better than adjuvant radiotherapy alone in disease control. The most important prognostic factors affecting the post-operative survival rate of patients are the number of positive lymph node and LN levels involved, the percentage of positive dissected LN and neural invasion.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: An important issue for cancer patients, who are destined to receive craniospinal irradiation (CSI), is how to reduce the overall time needed for simulation. Furthermore, it is necessary that more accurate tools are designed and adapted so that there is increased accuracy in the determination of the optimal irradiation position and field. This will increase the level of confidence of radiation oncologists with respect to these factors. In this study, we investigated and evaluated simulation techniques that utilize computed tomography (CT) for simulation of craniospinal irradiation. Material and Methods: A PQ5000 computed tomography simulator (CT-sim) has been available since 2000 at the Department of Radiation Oncology of Linkou Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital. The VOXEL Q treatment planning system and the ACQ-sim virtual simulation software were employed to access images for processing to allow the reconstruction of three-dimensional images and the accurate identification of the location and size of the tumor. Subsequently, the treatment-related parameters such as field size, the angles of gantry and collimator, and the customized block could be decided. Result: Conventional CSI simulation, which is similar to traditional X-ray simulation, is rather time consuming, requiring thirty to fifty minutes to accomplish all the processes. In addition, the patient must assume an uncomfortable prone position during which the chin and nose inevitably has to bear the weight of the head. In CT-sim, the patient adopts a supine position for CSI. With this simulation technique and position, not only does the patient feels much more comfortable as well as the simulation time needed being reduced to ten to fifteen minutes, but it also seems to be a more accurate method for determining the treatment parameters. Discussion: The benefits of CT-sim, when utilized for CSI, include a reduction in the simulation time to only one third of that needed for conventional X-ray simulation, an increased level of confidence for the radiation oncologist with respect to the determination of the radiation beam and field size and, most important of all, a decrease in treatment errors caused by patient motion during the simulation.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study is to report the clinical and dosimetric parameters of six patients who were carriers of type B chronic hepatitis and developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity after adjuvant or definitive concurrent chemoirradiation for gastric cancer. Materials and Methods: From December 1993 through July 2001, 82 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma underwent radiotherapy as adjuvant or definitive treatment. Ten patients were carriers of type B chronic hepatitis on serology test. Six of 10 patients who developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity within 4 months after radiotherapy, formed the basis of this study. Five patients underwent external-beam radiotherapy with 45 Gy/1.8 Gy/25 fractions and 18 MV photons delivered to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics Over 5 weeks. One patient had the radiotherapy with 50.4 Gy/28 fractions. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of 3-6 (median: 5) weekly cycles of intravenous infusion with 5fluorouracil 2 gm/m2 and leucovorin 300mg/m2 for 24 hours. Dose-volume histograms of the critical organs were used for the dosimetric factors in these patients.  Results: Six patients developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity, with a median interval of 38 days from completion of radiotherapy. One patient died of this complication and five patients recovered. All but one patient had either serologic or histological evidence of reactivation of chronic viral hepatitis. Mean dose of liver of the 6 patients ranged from 10.4 Gy to 22.9 Gy (mean: 17.2 Gy), while the percent volume receiving more than 30 Gy of radiation (V3o Gy) ranged from 7% to 37% (mean: 24%). Mean normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was 3.3%, ranging from 0.03% to 6.8%. Mean hepatic dose, V30GY, and NTCP were all significantly lower than those of the 12 patients with hepatocelular carcinoma and radiation-induced liver disease after three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Conclusion: Hepatic toxicity after concurrent chemoirradiation, in patients who were carriers of type B chronic hepatitis and underwent treatment for gastric cancer, deserves special attention and was rarely reported in the literature. The tolerance of liver to radiation was even lower than expected in the presence of concurrent chemotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study aimed to compare the predictive value of ICRU (International Committee on Radiation Units and Measurements) and conventional rectal reference point with the risk of late rectal sequelae in patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated with high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDRICB). Materials and Methods: From September 1992 to December 1997, 181 cases (32 IB, 23 IIA, 102 IIB, 3IIIA, 2IIIB) who survived more than 12 months after treatment and the long-term survivors should receive a minimum 3 years of follow-up, were entered in our study. Initially, they were treated with 10 MV X-rays for 44 - 45 Gy / 22 - 25 fractions over 4-5 weeks to whole pelvis Radiation dose for patients with FIGO Stage IIB-III bilateral parametrial disease was boosted to 54-58 Gy, with a central shielding. After the completion of whole-pelvis radiotherapy, HDRICB was performed using an Ir-192 remote after loading technique at one-week intervals. Fifty-one patients received three insertions, while 130 patients had four insertions. The prescribed dose for each HDRICB was 7.2 Gy to Point A for three insertions (before July 1995), or 6.0 Gy for four insertions (after July 1995). HDRICB dosimetry was calculated using orthogonal films exposed during each insertion. Doses to both ICRU and conventional rectal reference points were calculated for each patient. The overall duration of treatment ranged from 47-90 days (median, 60). Patient and treatment related factors were evaluated for late rectal complication using logistic regression model. Results: Median follow-up of these patients was 58 months (range: 38-110 months). Forty-five patients (24.9%) had late rectal complications (27 Grade 1, 13 Grade 2, 5 Grade 3-4). The probability of rectal complications shows a better correlation of doseresponse with increasing total brachytherapy ICRU rectal dose. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated a high risk of late rectal sequelae in patients who had Stage IIB-III disease (p = 0.002, relative risk, 3.66, 95% CI 1.82-6.45) and total ICRU rectal dose greater than 20 Gy (p = 0.005, relative risk, 1.62, 95% CI1.03-3.21). Conclusions: This study confirms the value of ICRU rectal reference point in the prediction of late rectal sequelae. Patients who have Stage IIB-III disease, or a total ICRU rectal dose greater than 20 Gy, have a higher risk of late rectal sequelae.',\n",

Materials and Methods: Between 1st, Dec. 1985 and 31, Dec. 1991, 126 patients with pathology proven stages I and II carcinoma of the uterine cervix were treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy (some of them underwent abdominal total hysterectomy) (ATH) followed with post operative irradiation at Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang-hua Christian Hospital. The indications for radiotherapy were based on pathologic findings including lymph node metastasis, positive Surgical margins, lymphovascular permeation, primary tumor size≧3.0 cm, parametrial involvement, corpus invasion, previous inadequate surgery (ATH) or more than one combination of the above. Patients usually received external beam irradiation 39.6 Gy to 61.2 Gy to the whole pelvis, and the vaginal cuff were boosted by intravaginal brachytherapy. All patients who received complete course of radiotherapy had follow-up period between 8 and 256 months (median: 113 months). The prognosis related histologic parameters including histologic subtypes, tumor grade, longitudinal tumor dimension, lymphovascular space invasion, corpus invasion, parametrial extension, vaginal invasion and pelvic lymph node(s) (PLN) metastases were collected and evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: All the 126 cases were evaluated, analyzed and followed until closure of this study (Jun. 2001). Half(63) of all the cases died. The survival duration was calculated from time of histologic diagnosis to the time of last follow-up or death. The estimated 5- and 10-year survival rate of surgical stages IB, IIA and IIB were 65%, 75%, 62% and 59%, 49%, 53%respectively (p ＞ 0.05). Univariate analysis revealed that PLN metastases, histologic subtype, tumor size and corpus invasion were significant in survival (p ＜ 0.05). Among these variables, we found that histologic subtype and PLN metastases were identified as the most independent and significant prognostic factors (p ＜ 0.005) which have major analysis using Cox regression model. Conclusions: In the current study, which enrolled 126 cases of cervical cancer patients having hysterectomy and post-operative irradiation, we found that histologic subtype (non-See from pathologic classification) and PLN metastases (number of metastatic nodes more than 2) have the worst 5- and 10year survival rate, and were recognized as two independent and significant prognostic variables by Cox's model.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: In order to increase the accuracy of radiotherapeutic treatment in the chest region and ensure the reproducibility of precise daily treatment portals [9,13], we design a chest immobilization device that better fits Chinese people and this is appropriate in the application for the treatment for esophageal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and so on. \\nMaterials and Methods: To design the chest holder, we measure the width of patient's body and the length of patient's head, shoulders, and weight. The material of the chest holder is the acrylic. The CT number of the acrylic is the same with the muscle tissue of our body. We use the aquaplast on patients for immobilizing and marking. \\nResults: To verify the feasibility and quality of the chest holder, we compare the treatment portals taken in portal films and verification films. The discrepancy of the two figures are within 1~3 mm, which is clinically acceptable. \\nConclusion: The advantage of the chest holder is the assurance of a daily accurate treatment and also the avoidance of placing the markers on patient's skin, which may produce the allergic reaction in convenience in daily living and patient's outlook change.\",\n",
       " 'Background and Purpose: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) indicated poor prognosis and is the contraindication for transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization (TAE). Although the conventional method of external irradiation to HCC has been proven not effective, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) may be an alternative choice. In this study, the prognostic factors and results of 3D-CRT to PVT area as the initial treatment for HCC with PVT patients who could not receive other treatments was investigated. \\nMaterials and Methods : From September 1997 to August 1999, 42 patients who were initially diagnosed as HCC with PVT without any previous treatment and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status superior to Grade II were enrolled into the study. Radiation therapy (RT) was given via 3D-CRT technique to PVT area with 50 Gy to 61.3 Gy in daily fraction of 1.8 Gy to 2.5 Gy by individual condition. Age, sex, ECOG performance status, Child-Pugh classification, tumor location, tumor type, invaded PVT area, radiation treatment volume, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding history, viral hepatitis markers for B and C, and pre-treatment liver function, on-treatment liver function, post-treatment liver function, including Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Total Bilirubin (Bil-T), were recorded for analysis. \\nResults: Twenty-four patients (57%) completed the RT course and others withdrew from RT due to worsened ECOG performance status. Seven complete RT patients were lost to follow-up. Nine of 17 followed patients (53%) had positive response to RT. Seven patients (41%) underwent further TAE after RT. In the patients who could complete RT, overall survival for 3 months and 6 months were 63% and 34%. Survival rate for incomplete RT patients was 24% and 8% for 3 months and 6 months respectively. There was statistically significant difference (p = 0.022) in survival between patients who completed RT and their counterpart. There were no significant difference in pre-treatment, on-treatment and post-treatment AST, ALT and Bil-T level. Only 6 patients (35%) were reported to have suspicious gastric complications. Bil-T was the only significant factor for predicting whether RT could be completed or not (p = 0.028). \\nConclusions : Less than half of the patients completed the planned RT and were adequately followed, indicating the poor prognosis and selection of patients in this study. Further prospective control studies with appropriate patient enrollment, such as low bilirubin level, is required to verify the feasibility, patterns of failure, and the possible benefit of 3D-CRT as the initial treatment of HCC with PVT.',\n",
       " 'Purpose:To analyze the prognostic factors and treatment results in patients with brainstem gliomas following radiotherapy. \\nMaterials and Methods:Between 1986 and 2000, 44 patients with brain stem gliomas were evaluated retrospectively. Included were 27 males and 17 females ranging in age from 3 to 74 years (median, 26.5 years). Out of 19 patients with histologically proven glioma, 13 had a partial tumor resection. These patients were treated with various combinations of surgery and radiotherapy. A median total tumor dose of 55.9 Gy was given in daily fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy. The median follow up time of survivors was 3years.\\nResults: Neurological improvement was achieved in 16/44 patients. Reduction of tumor size was reported in 4/44, in 28 patients the lesion was unchanged, and 12 patients progressed radiologically. Median time to progression was 13.2 months, and median overall survival time was 17.9 months with an actuarial survival of 53% at 1 year, 37% at 2 years and 27% at 5 years. For patients who had Karnofsky performance score≧70%, their median overall survival was 31.6 months compared to 7.9 months for those who had Karnofsky performance score ＜ 70% (p = 0.037). None of the other potential prognostic factors evaluated (including patient age, gender, tumor grade, tumor location, subtotal resection, presence or absence of cranial nerve palsies, total dose, 3D conformal radiotherapy, duration of symptoms, or radiological response) were associated with patient overall survival in multivariate analysis.\\nConclusions:Karnofsky performance score is the most important prognostic factor in this study. The result of radiotherapy for brain stem glioma is still disappointed. It is necessary to continue to search for more effective treatment methods.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: Chromosomal changes, chromosome aberrations and sister-chromatid exchanges are widely used as indicators of chromosomal DNA damage. The relationship between numbers of SCE and low dose irradiation in V-79 cells was investigated. \\nMaterials and Methods: The Chinese hamaster cells, V-79 cell line, were grown and irradiated by low doses of 137Cs γ-ray at an exposure dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min. The sister-chromatid exchanges were stained by Sorensen's buffer containing Hoechst and Giemsa. Newman-Keuls test was employed to analyze the difference of SCEs between one group and others. The replication index and mitotic index of cells after the treatment of low dose γ-ray were also analyzed. \\nResults: The frequency of sister-chromatid exchange in the 0.01 Gy and 0.05 Gy groups comparing to control group were 36% and 40%, respectively. While the ratios of SCE in higher treated dose for 0.25 and 0.5 Gy were 50% and 53%, respectively. With dose increasing, ratios of SCE became saturated. In addition, the data were analyzed by dividing into four sections (≦5, 6-8, 9-11, and≧12) based on SCE numbers in each cell. The results demonstrated that SCE numbers in all treated groups were mainly in 6~8 and 9~11 sections, and percentages were about 66~68 %. It was only 46% for control group and 52% fall down in the section of≦5. The section of ≧12 in control group has only 2%. \\nConclusions: Low dose irradiation of 137Cs indeed induced SCE in V79 cells as low as 0.01 Gy, but not increase linearly. In this study, SCE numbers increased quickly at first division from 0 to 0.01 Gy, and the increased frequency in second part was slow down. Low dose irradiation not only increase SCE numbers, but also change the distribution of SCE numbers.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: To use Rotterdam nasopharyngeal applicator to examine its results on radiation dose distribution and investigate the possible indications for the treatment of nasopharyngeal tumor. \\nMaterials and Methods: We compared three types of HDR nasopharyngeal brachytherapy applicators that were used in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou. The three types of applicators were: single metal tandem, balloon applicator and Rotterdam applicator. Three types of applicators were tested in one patient with AJCC stage T1 nasopharyngeal cancer. We further selected five patients with different tumor extension as representative to compare the radiation dose distribution. The five repre-sentative case included T2o: tumor extended to oropharynx, T2n: tumor to nasal cavity, T2b: tumor to parapharynx space, T3: tumor to skull base and T4: tumor to brain. We use MRI to define the tumor, CT scan and commercial software to calculate the radiation dose. The feasibility, reproducibility and patients' comfort were also be evaluated. \\nResults: We found that Rotterdam applicator was more reproducible and best radiation dose distribution to nasopharyngeal mucosa or submucosa tumor area compared to the other 2 applicators. The Rotterdam applicator can deliver prescribed dose to the lesion area without too much hot spot in the treatment of T1-T2a NPC. However, when Rotterdam applicator was placed to the nasopharynx for few days during the treatment, patients would feel much discomfort. It therefore needed intravenous medication or fluid to relieve patients' discomfort. Besides, Rotterdam applicator also has the limitation in coverage of tumor with huge parapharyngeal space extension or to intracranial area. For the treatment of advanced NPC, it may still be at the price of very high radiation hot spot and face the risk of severe necrosis or bone perforation.\\nConclusion : With the treatment of small nasopharyngeal tumor, we will suggest Rotterdam applicator to be the choice as an aid of brachytherapy boost. However, there will be a great potential to improve the shape of the Rotterdam applicator to fit better in our patients in order to be common use for the improvement of the radiation dose distribution to the nasopharyngeal area.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: Many authors have discussed radiation dose distributions of an192Ir source in Water. The purpose of our study is to analyze dose distribution of 192Ir in heterogeneity, such as bone and lung tissue, using Monte Carlo calculation and TLD measurements. \\nMaterial and Methods : An EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation program, incorporating with detailed source construction, has been used to investigate the dose distribution in water, bone and lung phantoms. TLD measurements were also performed to verify the calculating accuracy. The small size (1mm x 1mm x 1mm cube) TLD-100H LiF dosimeter is chosen to minimize the influence of dose gradient in measurement. The compositions of bone and lung phantoms are referred to ICRU report 44. \\nResults: The radial dose function and anisotropy function in water agree with published data in less than 1%. The radial dose function in bone decreases with depth much more than those in water and the difference can be up to 21%. In contrast, the dose distribution in lung shows less attenuation and scatter than in water and the difference can be up to 16%. The TLD measurements and Monte Carlo results agree within statistical uncertainty (approximately +/- 5%) when the radial distance is larger than 1 cm. At 0.5-cm radial distance, the extreme high dose gradient causes the measurement uncertainty to become too large to estimate the consistency. \\nConclusions: Most of previous studies focused on the dosimetry around an Iridium-192 in water. Through this study, we obtain a better understanding of the dose distributions in heterogeneities, bone and lung tissue.',\n",

       " 'Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), representing the most common type of the thyroid cancer, is usually slow-growing and runs an indolent clinical course. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes is a common finding. Patients with initial N1 stage or higher have higher local recurrence rate. The prognosis had been related to the age at initial diagnosis, tumor size, sex, extent of surgical resection, presence of extrathyroid invasion, multi centricity and presence of distant metastasis [4]. Distant metastasis is uncommon, especially intracranial metastasis that is rare with a frequency of 0.1-5% in reported series Cerebral hemispheres are the most common site of intracranial metastasis in reported series. We report a case of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with metastasis to a very unusual location of left cerebellopotine angle and present our experience of successful management for this case with combined modalities including surgery, post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy and radioiodine therapy. Literature reviews of this unusual clinical presentation are also discussed.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the treatment outcome of patients with primary operable invasive breast cancer who received radiotherapy at a medical center from 1998 to 2000.\\nMaterials and Methods: We recruited 341 consecutive patients of primary operable invasive breast cancer who received radiotherapy in the department of radiation oncology of the authors’ medical center from 1998 to 2000. A median dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions was delivered to the chest wall and/or regional lymph nodes of patients who had received mastectomy. For those who had received breast-conserving surgery, another tumor boost dose of 15 to 20 Gy (total dose: 65 to 70 Gy) was given. Information on each patient was collected by reviewing the medical records, and clinical outcome was compared.\\nResults: The median follow-up time for the 341 patients was 2.6 years (range, 7 months to 13.1 years). Among them, 142 received breast-conserving surgery and 199 received mastectomy. Systemic chemotherapy was used on 264 patients (77%) as a neoadjuvant of adjuvant treatment. The local-control rate at 5 years was 81.4%. The disease-free survival and local control at 5 years by stage were 95.5% and 100% for stage I, 93.2% and 98% for stage IIA, 62.4% and 92.1% for stage IIB, 58.8% and 80.5% for stage IIIA, and 43.7% and 75.4% for stage IIIB, respectively. A total of 24 patients (7.1%) had locoregional recurrence, which occurred at 5 months to 5.5 years (median, 1.6 years). But for the 142 BCS patients, only one of them developed local recurrence till now (median, 2.1 years).\\nConclusion: Radiotherapy is a very effective adjuvant treatment on local control in breast cancer patients. Survival and local recurrence rates were comparable to other series. Our results also showed a very low rate of recurrence for patients receiving breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Our objective in this study is to review the results of radiotherapy for patients of undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharynx (UCN), in terms of local control and overall survival. We also evaluated different prognostic factors for patient survival.\\nMaterials and Methods: A retrospective review was done on 283 patients with UNC patients treated at the department of radiation oncology, Changhua Christian Hospital from 1984 to 1997. All cases were classified histologically according to the WHO criteria for nasopharyngeal tumor, and were then re-staged according to the 4th American joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC, 1992) staging system. Radiotherapy (RT) consisted of 70.2 Gy to the primary tumor with optional boost dose depending on tumor response. Regional lymphatics were irradiated with a dose ranging from 50.4Gy to 70.2 Gy, based on the size of the involved lymph nodes. A cobalt-60 or 6 MV X-ray linear accelerator (Seimens Mevatron) was used for radiotherapy. All patients were then followed-up regularly until death. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine actuarial survival. Logrank test and Cox regression analysis were used for comparison and determination of prognostic factors.\\nResults: Among the 283 patients, a total of 50 patients were excluded from our study due to incomplete treatment. The mean dose received by these patients were 27.09 Gy (range: 3 Gy – 47.5 Gy). Their overall 5-year actuarial survival was only 16.1 %, with a median survival of 14 months. Thirty-seven of 50 patients died. The mortality rate was 74% (37/50), with most of them dying from systemic disease. The remaining 233 patients were analyzed. The male to female ratio was 2.4:1. Three were 28 patients with local recurrence, reflecting a local control rate of 87.9%. Cox regression analysis revealed that N stage was the only significant factor for local control. Sixty (26%) patients developed distant metastasis, mainly to the bone, the lung, and the liver. Analysis revealed that N stage, WHO type and stage were significant factors affecting distant metastasis. The 5-year survival for stage I / II , III, and IV patients were 80% , 65.7% and 49.7%, respectively .Our analysis revealed that N stage were significant prognostic factors for overall survival.\\nConclusion: Radiotherapy remains the treatment of choice for undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharyns (UCN). However, due to a high rate of distant metastasis, chemotherapy in addition to radiotherapy should be the direction for future clinical trial.',\n",

Patients were treated with definitive pelvic and prophylactic para-aortic radiotherapy, concomitant chemotherapy, and post-radiation chemotherapy Radiation treatments included external radiation to the para-aortic area with 45 Gy in 25 fractions and to the whole pelvis with 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions, additional boost to the parametrium with 9 Gy in 5 fractions, and the intracavitary brachytherapy with point A doses of 22-30 Gy in 4-5 fractions. Chemotherapy included 2 cycles of cisplatinum 60-80 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 29 during radiotherapy , and 2 cycles of cisplatinum 60-80 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 600-800 mg/m2/day for 5 days, at 1 and 2 months after completion of radiotherapy. Patients were followed on a regular basis. The survival outcome was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, and the treatment-related side effects were evaluated by RTOG criteria. The median follow-up interval was 15 months. \\nResults: All patients completed the planned radiotherapy and the planned 2 cycles of chemotherapy during radiotherapy. Sixteen patients (80%) underwent 2 cycles of the post-radiation chemotherapy, while 4 of them had modification of chemotherapy regimens. One patient had local recurrence, with the 2-year local control rate of 83%. None of the 20 patients had para-aortic recurrence, but one patient developed lung metastasis. All patients were alive and the 2-year survival rate was 100%. Most treatment-related side effects were gastrointestinal and hematological reactions. No patient had grade IV acute toxicity. For gastrointestinal toxicity, there were four patient(20%) with grade III reaction. For hematological toxicity, there were five patients (25%) with grade III reaction. All but 2 patients had the late toxicities less than or equal to grade II. No patient had the interruption of radiation therapy due to the treatment-related adverse effects. \\nConclusion: Definitive radiotherapy with prophylactic para-aortic irradiation and concur-rent chemotherapy are safe and well tolerated for patients with FIGO stage IIB-IIIB cervical carcinoma. The preliminary survival results were acceptable. Long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the side effects and outcome with this intensive treatment combination.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the failure patterns of chest wall recurrence after postmastectomy radiotherapy (RT) in the patients with locally advanced breast cancer and the outcome of re-irradiaton.\\nMaterials and Methods: From January 1978 to December 1996, 17 patients with pathology confirmed recurrent breast cancer were included in this study. The recurrent chest wall was treated with 4 or 6 MV photon through tangential field technique or 9 MeV electron beam through anterior or oblique portal, in a daily dose of 2 Gy, 5 days per week. Total dose ranged from 20 to 60 Gy with the average dose of 48 Gy.\\nResults: The median survival time from chest wall recurrence was 16 mouths, ranged from 3 months to 3.5 years. There was 90% of recurrence occurred within 2 years after postmastectomy irradiation, and 71% recurrent site occurred in the previous RT field. Fourteen patients (82%) developed distant metastases. Lung was the most common site.\\nConclusion: Re-irradiation to the chest wall played only a palliative role. Further systemic management should be investigated and recommended due to high incidence of distant metastases.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the treatment results and relapse patterns for nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) with unusual histological features.\\nMaterials and Methods: From Dec 1983 to April 1997, nine cases of carcinoma occur-ring in the nasopharynx, which were characterized by unusual histological presentations, underwent radiotherapy at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou. The histological diagnoses for these patients were adenoid cystic carcinoma (n= 4), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (n= 3), and mucoepider-moid carcinoma (n= 2). This group consisted of two females and seven males, with a median age of 41 years (range, 15 to 72). Two patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma and one with the adenoid cystic variant underwent transpalate excision of the tumor before irradiation. All patients were treated with definite irradiation, with total dose to the nasopharynx ranging from 6480 to 7280 cGy (median, 7080).\\nResults: The five and ten-year overall survival rates, derived using the Kaplan-Meier method, were 44.4% and 29.6%, respectively. Median survival was 2.73 years. Local recurrence occurred for six of the patients (66%). The duration to local recurrence varied from 12 to 113 months, with a median of 33 months. Two patients developed distant metastasis to lung or liver.\\nConclusion: Nasopharyngeal carcinomas with unusual histological features are rare. As a result, the small number of such cases diagnosed during the study period limited the statistical power of this study. Relatively advanced stage distribution and a greater proportion of local relapse after definite radiotherapy were observed, with these features probably accounting for the poor survival rate for NPC cases which are characterized by unusual histological features.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To compare intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment plans with conventional treatment plans for different stage of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. \\nMaterials and Methods: We used 3 cases of different T stage of nasopharyngeal cancer using IMRT techniques, as well as three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy technique (3D-CRT), and traditional bil-opposing fields technique. We use different combinations of techniques in initial and boost fields. These plans were compared with respect to dose conformality, dose-volume histogram (DVH) and dose to the sensitive normal tissue structures.\\nResults: The planned dose distributions were more conformal to the rumor target volume by IMRT in T1 and T3 tumor but not in T4 lesion with extending to eye balls level. To achieve the parotid and ear organs preservation purpose, IMRT should be done from the beginning of radiotherapy. The IMRT technique may deliver more radiation dose to eye balls for the lesion over the ethmoid sinus nearing the orbit level. The radiation dosage and conformality will be lost after the limitation of the eye structure.\\nConclusion: The IMRT will gain the benefit of parotid sparing in different stage of tumor and the concave shape tumor. However, the IMRT with co-planar treatment planning may cause some harm to eye structures for the lesion at the central such as upper ethmoid sinus area.',\n",

After modeling the Siemens PRIMUS linear accelerator, phase space data is collected at SSD= 100 cm for following dose distribution simulation in a water phantom. Dose distribution simulation is carried out for 6 MV and 15 MV, 10 × 10、20 × 20 and 30 ×30 cm2 fields in a water phantom. The phantom size in 30 cm in radius and 10 cm in thickness. The areas selected for dose calculation of 10 × 10、20 × 20 and 30 ×30 cm2 fields are 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 cm in radius, respectively. Total twenty voxels of thickness 0.05mm (50μm) from water surface and 1 voxel of thickness 0.1cm at Dmax were selected for dose calculation. The dose ratios of voxels at surface region to voxel at Dmax form the PDD curve at surface region.\\nResult and Discussion: The relative error of all voxels is within 1% with the exception of some voxels within 2% in 30 × 30 cm2 field. The PDD curves at surface region were fit with 4th order polynomial function. The x2 value of each fitting is better than 0.997. The PDD value at water surface ( X=0) for 6 MV, 10 × 10、20 × 20 and 30 × 30 cm2 fields are 13.67 ± 0.17%、23.07 ± 0.35% and 29.75 ± 0.52%, respectively. For 15 MV, the values are 8.71± 0.06%、18.77 ± 0.14% and 27.06 ± 0.32%, respectively.\\nConclusion: The PDD value at water surface can be taken as reference for modeling of treatment planning system. This study only carried out the simulation for 6 and 15 MV open fields. More efforts on surface PDD of physical wedge and dynamic wedge fields are needed to widen the clinical application.',\n",
       " 'Two cases of lower limb soft tissue sarcoma, one malignant fibrous histiocytoma and one liposarcoma, were treated by surgery and a postoperative high dose rate of interstitial brachytherapy with and without external beam irradiation in Taichung Veteran General Hospital. Both cases were advanced stage and high grade in histology at presentation and had a high concern for leg preservation. Conservative surgical treatments were performed by wide excision and marginal excision, respectively. The interstitial catheters were implanted with 1-cm spacing in a parallel array intra-operatively. High dose rate brachytherapy was planned by Plato Brachytherapy Planning System and was started 4 days after the operation by the application of the micro selection after loader using iridum-192 as the irradiation source. The total doses were 2880cGy and 2800 cGy respectively and were applied in 8 and 7 fractions was given to one case but was withheld in the second case due to delayed wound healing after brachytherapy. There were on significant wound complications in the first case. There was also no bone fracture or peripheral nerve damage in either case except muscle fibrosis occurred after the irradiation. Both of the patients were satisfied with the function of the preserved limbs during a follow up one year later. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was seen at present. For advanced lower limbs soft tissue sarcoma, wide excision plus interstitial brachytherapy may be an alternative management for the preservation of the limbs. Though we had a good initial local control of these two cases but it does not indicate there will be a good prognosis later on. However it did improve the patient’s quality of life and their self-con-fidence in facing the disease. Further long-term follow-up is necessary and hopefully there will be good long-term survival in the future.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To generate a modified 3-D radiotherapy planning that can be delivered easily and safely, and treat the targets adequately in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\\nMaterials and Methods: The stage 14 NPC patients without distant metastasis, especially with a huge tumor approaching or close to the brain stem, were selected for this Treatment planning under curative intent. The CMS.FOCUS planning system was used to generate these 3-D radiotherapy plans. The plans were evaluated with respect to daily treatment time and ease of treatment delivery, achievement of dose requirement to tumor with normal tissue sparing, dose-volume histograms of gross target volume and critical normal structures, potential radiobiological effects and toxicity of concurrent chemotherapy. The treatment responses were defined by the serial follow-up MRI and Tc-99mnuclear scans.\\nResults: Each time only 2-4 portals were needed to deliver a tumoricidal dose (200 cGyonce a day to 7000 cGy, or 120 cGy twice a day to 7440 cGy) to 100% of the primary tumor target volume while still keeping the doses of the adjacent critical normal structures within safety limits. The DVH of GTV is similar to that of IMRT but the DVHs of spinal cord and mandible are similar to those of 3DCRT. The highest dose was centered to the heavy tumor burden area. There was no any hot spot in normal tissue. This treatment was well tolerated and showed only moderate toxicity, even with concurrent chemotherapy. The complete response was confirmed by serial MRI and Tc.99m nuclear scans after treatment.\\nConclusion: This modified 3-D radiotherapy was effective, efficient, and safe in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Longer follow-up and more patients are needed to establish the true clinical advantage.',\n",

One year and 2-year survival rate were 60% and 30% respectively. Follow up imaging study showed tumor reduction greater than 50% in 6 patients (16%), reduction less than 50% or unchanged in 14 patients (38%) and progression in 17 of the 37 patients (46%). On analysis of different prognostic factors, patient's age (＜50 years and≧50 years), extent of surgical resection, and tumor volume (＜20 ml) were correlated with survival in univariate analysis (p＜0.05). Tumor volume and extent of surgical resection remained significant in multivariate analysis. The performance status remained stable for all patients during FSRT and only 5 patients (13%) suffered from treatment related acute toxicity with good medication control.\\nConclusion: Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy provides a safe and feasible technique in the primary treatment of malignant gliomas. Although the overall survival and 1 year survival is encouraging, we did not observe a significant dose-effect relationship on overall and progression-free survival. Large series study with long term fallow-up is indicated.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose:To evaluate and discuss the therapeutic results and technique of conjunctival lymphoma. \\nMaterials and Methods: This retrospective study was to review the 10 patients with conjunctival lymphoma treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1988 to 1996. There were 8 men and 2 women. The range of age was 32 - 75 years old, mean: 59.1 years old. Most of the patients presented with conjunctival mass, reddish eyes and forelgn body sensation. The conjunctival lesions in all patients were treated with a single anterior field which covered the entire conjunctiva, using 3 MeV to 10 MeV electron beam. Total dose of 30 Gy to 50 Gy was delivered in 15 to 25 fractions over 23 to 33 days. In all cases, a specially designed lead shield was used to protect the lens. The follow-up time ranged from 24 months to 124 months.\\nResults: All patients were doing well with no sign of active localized or distant disease till the closing date of the study. Moreover, the complications, including decreased visual acuity, cataract and photophobia, were minimal.\\nConclusion: Lymphoma clinically localized to conjunctiva as the initial presentation can be cured by radiation therapy with a dosage of 30 Gy to 40 Gy. The complications of radiation therapy can be minimized with sophisticated treatment technique and well protection of the highly radiosensitive lens.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: To determine the variability of patient setup errors during three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for prostate cancer treatment without immobilization or with different immobilization devices.\\nMaterials and Methods : Forty-eight prostate cancer patients treated with 3D-CRT were prospective evaluated. They were treated by the same physician, technician and  machine. Five groups of patients and technique were compared: (A) supine position without immobilization; (B) prone position without immobilization, but with belly-board; (C) prone position with belly-board and cast immobilization; (D) supine position with alpha cradle from waist to below knee immobilization; (E) supine position with stereotactic body frame immobilization. Serial portal films were recorded and compared with simulation films. The deviation in each axis and rotation angle were compared.\\nResults: Group A has the least deviation in X-axis of anterior-posterior view CAP-X; p = 0.044); group B has the least deviation in Z-axis of anterior-posterior view (AP-Z; p = 0.065); group 0 has the least deviation in rotation angle of anterior-posterior view (AP-Ang.; p = 0.067); group E has the least deviation in rotation angle of lateral view (Lat-Ang. ; p = 0.078). There is no significant difference in deviation both in each directions and angles according to body habitus as normal or obese. Heavier weight has less AP-Z and Lat-Z deviation (p = 0.011 and p = 0.108); the deviation of Lat-Z has positive correlation with AP-Z (p ＜ 0.001), deviation AP-X has positive correlation with deviation Lat-Z and Lat-Ang. (p = 0.037 and p = 0.05 ). For patients with thickness of pelvic circumference (PC-AP) ＜ 19.0 cm have the least deviation in AP-Z (p = 0.034), Lat-Ang. (p = 0.034) in group B and the least AP-Ang. (p = 0.031) in group D; for patients with width of pelvic circumference (PC-Lat) ＜ 35.0 cm have the least deviation in AP-X (p = 0.013) in group A, Lat-Z in group C; for patients with body weight ＜ 67.5 kg have the least deviation in AP-X (p = 0.039) in group A. \\nConclusion: Group A has better setup error in AP-X and Lat-Z with statistics significant (p ＜ 0.05), group B has better setup error in AP-Z; group D and E have better setup error in rotation angle; group C has less setup error in Lat-Y, but without statistical significance.

       " 'Purpose: Measuring the photoneutron contamination of 15 MV X-ray and various electrons emitted from Siemens PRIMUS linear accelerator by using bubble detector. \\nMaterials and Methods: Various bubble detectors are arranged around the linac head with the interval of 1m and the same height of isocenter to measure the dose equivalent distribution in the treatment room. The measurements were perform for 15 MV x-rays with 40×40 cm2 and 0×0 cm2 fields and for 15, 18, and 21 MeV electrons with 25×25 cm2 electron cone.\\nResults: Neutron dose equivalent rate in the points of measurement in the treatment room decreased with increased distance to isocenter. The maximum neutron dose equivalent are at isocenter, and its values for 15 MV 40×40 cm2 and 0×0 cm2 are 184.3±9.0 and 16.99±5.99 mRem per Gy x-ray, respectively.

Currently, in VGHTPE Hospital, daily manually calibration and documentation on each radiotherapy machine have been used on quality assurance, which is time consuming while performing data integration and transfermation inter machines. Therefore, we set up an intranet system to perform automatic calibration and integrate database to shorten the processing time of quality assurance meanwhile acquire up dated and complete report after all the procedures have been done.\\nMaterials and Methods: 1. Design WebPages in data transfermation and integration, use Microsoft visual basic 6.0 and Borland C++ builder 4.0 to design intranet webpages for treatment machines. There are two modules (therapeutic technique and mechanical quality assurance) installed on each treatment station, and the tolerance tables are well defined. 2. In running the daily calibration, design a virtual water solid phantom (water-equivalent) to acquire the energy distribution and decide the depth of the ion chamber. According to the size of the build up cap of the tested ion chamber to decide the size of the cylinder. The size of build up phantom is 30 cm by 30 cm and the depths are varied. By using these devises, we can run the tests on the daily radiation output stability, x-ray stability, beam flatness and asymmetry, optical range-finder, portal accuracy and laser beam alignment and all the data are recorded. \\nResult: Obtaining and transferring all of the data mentioned above from various treatment machines to the main sever, we could integrate data and formulate reports at daily, weekly, monthly and annually bases and further plot histograms according to different requirements. By performing these procedures, we could assure the quality of the treatment machines and build detailed database for property analysis. \\nConclusion: While we emphasize the quality assurance of radiotherapy, the quality assurance of treatment machines becomes the most important issue. Therefore, via practically use computer network system in quality assurance of radiotherapy machines is the most effective way to reach the goal of better quality assurance.',\n",

       " 'Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a very rare soft tissue tumor which usually occurs in the lower extremity of young adults. We described two cases of ASPS in terms of natural history and clinical outcome.\\nThe first case was a female patient who noticed a painless swelling in her left thigh at the age of 33. She underwent total removal of the tumor followed by post-operative radiation therapy for 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The diagnosis was ASPS. Five years after surgery, CXR showed multiple nodules which were proved to be metastasis by open lung biopsy. Brain metastasis developed three months later and was irradiated by Gamma-knife. Six months after radiosurgery for metastatic brain lesion, the patient underwent surgical excision for recurrent and newly developed metastatic brain lesions, followed by chemotherapy with Epirubicin, Ifosfamide and Mesna. Follow-up brain CT scan 6 months later revealed multiple nodules. The patient received radiation therapy to the whole brain but could not complete the course. She died of lung and brain metastases one month later. The second case was a 26-yearold man presented with low back pain. MRI of T-L spine revealed multiple lesions in the vertebral bodies with thecal sac compression at T11. ASPS was confirmed by a surgical decompression with partial removal of the extradural tumor. Routine CXR revealed multiple lung nodules. A meticulous clinical search led to find the primary tumor located at lateral aspect of the left thigh. He underwent T-L spine irradiation for 40.5 Gy in 17 fractions and systemic chemotherapy with Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide for 3 months. However, no response was shown. The patient died of the disease 15 months after diagnosis. \\nASPS tends to metastasize both early and late. Surgical excision is the mainstay of therapy. Radiation therapy may enhance local control after surgery or provide meaningful palliation for metastasis.',\n",
       " 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant neoplasm in East Asia. HCC has the tendency to invade vessels, mainly the portal venous system. Right atrium metastasis through venous invasion is a rare condition with grave prognosis. Surgical resection of intra-atrial tumors is technically difficult and it is too invasive for the seriously ill patients. Here, we present a 58-year-old male patient of HCC with hepatic veins, inferior vena cava, and right atrium invasion, who received well-designed three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (totally 60 Gy 33 fractions), followed by one course of intra-arterial chemotherapy with cisplatin (65 mg/m2 infusion for 6 hours) and 5-fluorouracil (2,200 mg/m2 infusion for 24 hours). Serum alpha-fetoprotein was markedly decreased, and size of tumor thrombus was shrinkage. This patient survived for 15 more months. Therefore, for HCC patients with right atrium metastasis, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plus chemotherapy may be an effective salvage treatment.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To probe into junction fields techniques of radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients who need radical radiotherapy to whole pharyngeal wall and whole neck lymphatics.\\nMaterial and Methods : We get a simulation film and CT scan image of an Alderson Rando phantom for defining field size and lsocenter, and for computer planning system In this study, we showed dose distribution data of monoisocentric technique and moving junction technique with or without bolus. Two different bolus were used: bolus 1 emphasized only AP depth, bolus 2 emphasized both AP and bilateral depth. So there were six various combinations by either monoisocentric or moving junction with or without bolus. First, isodose distribution by computer planning system was generated to decide where to place TLDs. The average radiation dose in different techniques were obtained by irradiating the phantom packed with TLDs.\\nResults: Both monoisocentric techniques and moving junction techniques with adequate bolus could generate homogenous dose distributions. But if there were no bolus, there was hot area over neck. However there were still uneven dose distribution areas, such as hot areas in anterior superficial neck and lateral neck; cold areas in posterior lower neck. In comparison, monoisocentric technique with bolus 2 tended to create better dose distribution. After comparing data from TLDs and computer planning system, we found most differences were within 4%. However, inconsistency still existed in some locations such as field margins (underestimate 19-22%); junction areas (over/underestimate 9%); superficial areas (underestimate 5-7%).\\nConclusion: Both monoisocentric techniques and moving junction techniques combined with well-designed bolus can be satisfactorily applied in treating head and neck cancer patients with huge neck lymphadenopathy. There are not only good reproducibili﹒ ty but also good homogeneity. How to choose the optimal technique depends on patients' clinical status and individual hospital equipments. We suggest that the monoisocentric technique is a more convenient technique in junction fields. However, an well designed bolus is also very important to get a good dose distribution.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: A numerical electron dose calculation algorithm was introduced in 1992 by McLellan who used equal space sampling method to simulate electron energy loss and angular scattering distribution. The drawback of this numerical algorithm was its long calculation time. In our study, an equal probability sampling method was adopted in hope that less sampling points were necessary while the same calculation accuracy can still be maintained. Calculation results for electron energy loss process in homogeneous media were reported.\\nMaterial and Methods: The multiple scattering theory of Moliere was used in the modified numerical algorithm to simulate electron angular scattering; while Landau's ionizational energy loss theory was used to simulate electron energy loss process. At present, energy loss due to bremsstrahlung production was not included in the algorithm. Test calculation of collisional stopping power for 20, 10 and 6 MeV electrons incident into water under simplified condition (excluding electron multiple scattering) was performed. The energy loss process for the same setup was also simulated. In order to verify the calculation accuracy of the numerical code, EGS4 Monte Carlo code was adopted to perform benchmark calculation.\\nResults: When excluding electron multiple scattering, the calculation of collisional stopping power shows discrepancy of less than 2% between numerical calculation and ICRU reports for high energy electrons (20 and 10 MeV). For low electrons (6 MeV), this discrepancy is close to 3%. The calculation esults of absolute depth-dose distribution demonstrate that the calculated depths of 50% dose agree with EGS4 to within 3 mm and the calculated electron ranges to within 2 mm.\\nConclusion: Landau's theory is suitable for simulating electron ionizational energy loss in homogeneous media and the error due to equal probability sampling of electron energy loss distribution is acceptable.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this work is to apply EGS4 code to calculate the 3D spatial dose distribution around a shielded cylindrical applicator set and propose a way to implement the results based on Monte Carlo method into clinical applications. \\nMaterials and Methods : The simulation model of 3D spatial dose distribution was established by using EGS4 code and was compared with the results measured in our previous study and evaluated by existing commercial treatment planning system. Furthermore, the dose distributions for unit intensity lr-l92 source of each probable combination of source and shielding situations were pre-calculated and sayed as a database. A graphical user interface for accessing this database was developed by using IDLTM (Interactive Data Language).\\nResults: The results calculated by the 3D-simulation model established in this work show good agreement with the results measured in our previous study. The comparison of the existing commercial treatment planning system also show good agreement at prescribed dose in radial direction, but same discrepancy in Source axis. This discrepancy is due to the commercial treatment planning system that neglected the heterogeneity effect, such as the encapsulated material of source and the guide tube.\\nDiscussions: Through the interactive graphical user interface to access the database pre-calculated by EGS4, users could generate and display the dose distribution around the shielded cylindrical applicator set with Ir-192 source under any probable combination of source and shielding situations in 1, 2, or 3D plot. It seems to be a prototype of our treatment planning system based on Monte Carlo method for the shielded cylindrical applicator set.',\n",
       " 'Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (ESOS) is a rare malignancy that accounts for about 1 % of all soft tissue sarcomas. In contrast to osteosarcoma of bone which occurs most frequently in children and adolescents, ESOS primarily affects adults in their fourth and fifth decades. The thigh and buttocks are the most common primary tumor sites. There is a slight male to female predominance observed in most series. Generally, wide resection followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy is recommended. Local recurrence usually occurs in more than half of the patients, but distant metastasis, most common to the lung (＞80% of cases), is more common than local recurrence. The mortality rate ranges from 55.4% to 81 % and the median 5 years survival rate is less than 25%.\\nHere we represent a case of ESOS, which had been recurred many times after primary resection. We gave a high adjuvant radiation dose (7020 cGy) using the conedown fields technique and 6 cycles of epirubicin after wide excision of the recurrent tumor. Treatment related toxicities were limited to the treatment course and this student was able to continue his schooling while undergoing treatment.\\nTo date, no particular method of treatment seems to alter the survival rate of ESOS. After a short period of follow up, however, the combined modalities therapy, in our experience, has attained the object of initial local and systemic disease control.',\n",
       " 'Limb salvage surgery is currently used in treatment of osteogenic sarcoma in extremities by the advances in chemotherapy. Tumor prosthesis, allograft and autograft had been used for bone defect reconstruction. The use of autograft avoids some disadvantages of tumor prosthesis such as difficulty of soft tissue attachment and implant loosening after a period of time and decreases the probabilities of wound infection and nonunion as what might happen with allograft. So autograft provides the best result in bone reconstruction. However, it is impossible to find exactly the same length of autograft as what we had resected in the operation from our body. By the use of intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation to the tumor bearing bone segment, the soft tissue is preserved and the dead bone can be used to re-implant and substitute the bone defect. There is no limitation in dose escalation for irradiation of bone extracorporeally. The sarcomatous change of the adjacent normal soft tissue induced by radiation need not to be considered. In this paper, we tried to use this new method to provide a tumor free autograft for limb salvage surgery in two cases of locally advanced osteogenic sarcoma in lower limbs. A tumor dose of 30000 cGy was applied to the tumor bearing bone segment resected from both cases. The heavily irradiated specimen was sent back to the operation room immediately for re﹒implantation. The initial functional result was encouraging after six months of immobilization. Intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation with no dose limitation plays an important role in providing a sterile tumor free autograft with good bone union of the diseased leg. Unfortunately both cases had local tumor recurrence within one year after operation, inadequate neoadjuvant chemotherapy and inadequate (marginal) resection for locally advanced disease may be the main reasons for these early recurrences. We think that limb salvage surgery is a potential method only for some highly selected patients with good neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic response. Moreover, the tumor bearing bone segment should be resected with wide surgical margin to achieve a better long-term local tumor control.',\n",

The GSH concentrations in GBM cells treated with radiation and/or BSO (D, L-buthionine-S, R-sulfox-imine) were determined. Cells were irradiated with dosage ranged from 0 to 14 Gy with gamma radiation using a cobalt 60 machine. The concentration of GSH in irradiated GBM cells treated with or without BSO was evaluated under aerobic and hypoxic conditions.\\nResult: The intracellular concentration of glutathione ([GSH]) was 9.93± 0.46 ug/mg of cellular protein. In general, the [GSH] increased gradually after irradiated by cobalt-60 with 2~14 Gy. The [GSH] in OBM cells were 8.78±0.05 after treated with BSO. Also, [GSH] increased gradually after irradiated from low to high dose of irradiation. The [GSH] in hypoxic GBM cells were 32.45±0.25. It was 13.36±0.47 after treated with BSO. In general, the cellular [GSH] after irradiated from low to high dose of radiation increased gradually no matter treated with BSO or not. BSO is able to deplete the intracellular [GSH] but this is not significant in hypoxic cells 24 and 48 hours after treatment. Change of intracellular [GSH] is also not closely related with the present of oxygen or not.\\nConclusion: (1). In aerobic group, the GSH concentrations in OBM cells decrease after treated with BSO. In hypoxic group, the GSH concentration decreased only in cells analyzed immediately after irradiation. (2). There is no significant association between GSH concentrations of irradiated GBM cells and various oxygenated conditions. (3). In general, GSH concentration increase in proportional to radiation dose. This is more evident after treated the cells with BSO or 24~48 hours after irradiation Gradually increased concentration of GSH represents less repair of the damaged cells from radiation and more biologic effects in accordance with high radiation dose.',\n",

TNM staging was based on the hospital medical records. The survival status was based on regular follow-up (11/16) and interrupted follow-up combined with national mortality registry and telephone visits (5/16). The overall cause specific survival (OS), local-regional relapse free survival (LRRFS), and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), and disease free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nResults: After a median follow-up of 55 (7-81) months, 12 patients are survivors without disease, one died of local relapse, two died of distant metastases, and one died of concurrent disease (HCC).

The age distribution, sex, and histology subgroupings, are analyzed.\\nResults: There is a bimodal age distribution, peaked at 15 to 24 and 55 to 64.When age distribution was further analyzed according to the time of diagnosis, there is an increasing frequency of patients at the 15 to 24 age group and decreasing frequency of the 55 to 64 age group. Male to female ratio is 3.2: 1. For histological proved cases, mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease (MCHD) is the predominant type during 1970 to 1989. The incidence of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease (NSHD) is increasing during the study period. It has become the most prevalent histology type during 1990 to 1995.\\nConclusion: There are two significant changes in the demographic data of Hodgkin's disease at the time of diagnosis during the study period. First, the incidence of young adult patients is increasing. Second, the frequency of MCHD is decreasing and that of NSHD is increasing. These two changes are consistent with previous reports that economical status correlates with the age and histology subgroup distribution of Hodgkin's disease. Thus, our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that environmental or infectious agents are contributing factors in the pathogenesis of HD. Further multi-institutional study is warranted to confirm the significance of our observation.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: In an attempt to shorten patient setup time and increase setup reproducibility, we developed a supplemental system for a bilateral opposed technique of total body irradiation. We completed the dosimetry study and beam data measurement for clinical application.\\nMaterials and Methods: A small-size water phantom, (35 cm (L) x 35 cm (W) x 37 cm (H? with a lateral Mylar window, built in a farmer type chamber, was used for this measurement. The measurement was performed with 6 MV photon at 270° gantry angle, 45° and 135° collimator angle with maximum field size, and at 400~500 cm source-phantom distance. The measured items were dose rates, beam profiles, percent depth dose, and transmission factors for both tissue compensator and beam spoiler. \\nResults: The ratio of percent depth doses at 10 cm and 20 cm depth with in 400~500 cm SSD was 0.5%. The flatness of beam profiles was within (5% under the same conditions. The dose output ratios were also measured for clinical treatment. We measured the attenuation coefficient for the compensator material. Besides, we found that a 1 cm thick Lucite screen at 10 cm from the patient was enough to build up the surface dose.\\nConclusions: Our bilateral opposed technique for total body irradiation can achieve more comfortable and reproducible levels than that of conventional anterior/posterior technique. There is an advantage of using the arms of patients to shield the lungs, and it can reduce the lung dose effectively. Although this technique is not new, it can be a choice of total body irradiation.',\n",

Our experience with dosimetric measurements for this modality is reported.\\nMaterials and Methods: The source-to-surface distance (SSD) was extended to be 323 cm, and an 0.8 cm-thick acrylic screen was installed at 15 cm in front of the treatment plane to scatter the beam and attenuate the electron energy. At first, the optimal dual-field angle was determined in order to achieve feasible dose uniformity in the vertical dimension, and then field flatness could be assured. Film dosimetry was applied to define depth dose distribution profile of electron beam at treatment plane. Accordingly, the output of the linear accelerator could be calibrated. Multiplication factor was deter-mined to be 2.68, represented as the ratio of the absorbed dose from all six dual-fields to that from one dual-field measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) taped at Rando phantom. Thus, the value of MU for each field could be calculated. TLDs were used for in vivo dosimetry to verify the skin dose and evaluate dose variation at different anatomic sites.\\nResults: The determined dual-field angle (20 ) and multiplication factor (2.68) were comparable to those described in the literature. Depth dose distribution and beam penetration were satisfying, and X-ray background level (0.75%) was also acceptable. Markedly decreased output of the Linac (0.0684 cGy/MU) could be partially compensated with the escalation of dose rate (600 MU/min). Thus, each treatment would not cost too much time. Does variation among different sites at skin is compatible with the experience of other institutions. Instead, field flatness in the horizontal dimension (±1O% within 60 cm) did not meet the requirement given by AAPM.\\nConclusion: The technique of TSET is complex. Dosimetry for this modality should be studied case by case systematically and thoroughly.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This article introduces and compares the latest TO-51 clinical dosimetry protocol to the earlier protocol, TG-21. Based on the methodology of TG-21 and TG-51, the differences in clinical dosimetry measurements for both protocols are described and performed. Finally, precautions in performing the latest protocol were listed to avoid errors in clinic.\\nMaterials and Methods: The electrometer (Keithley 35617EBS) with 0.6 c.c. Farmer type cylindricalion chamber (NE2571) and 0.04 C.c. plane parallel ion chamber were employed for the measurements. The electrometer and ion chambers were authenticated by the Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratory (ADCL) in University of Texas. Varian linear accelerators Clinic6/100s/n: 358 (Photon beam energy with 6 MV) and Clinic1800 s/n:180 (Photon beam energies with 6 and 18 MV, electron beam with energies 6, 9, 12, 16 and 20 MeV) were used for output measurements. The measurement protocols were based on TG-21 and TG-51 respectively, with output doses obtained to observe the variations in the monitor unit of the absorbed dose (cGy/MU).\\nResults: The variations of monitor unit in 6 MV photon were within 0.7% and 1.4%, 18 MV photon was 2.2%, and the average for photon energies was 1.43%. The higher the photon energy, the larger the variation, suggesting that higher photon energies produce more scatter radiation due to wider distributed energy spectrum. For the electron beam, the variations in monitor units were within 1.5 - 2.2% with the average of 1.84%, showing no dependency with the electron beam energies. The variations in electron beam output were slightly higher than the photon beam, possible reasons are the measurement points in TO-51 protocol for electron beam is different from earlier protocl, a more precise method to prescribe the relationship between the clinical beam quality and stopping power ratio of the electron beam and the plane parallel ion chamber is considered for the electron beam measurements.\\nConclusion: The TG-51 protocol is simple campared to TG-21 protocol as large tables of stopping power ratios and mass-energy absorption coefficients are omitted and the user does not need to calculate any theoretical dosimetry factors, hence reduces calculation errors. For convenience, worksheets encompass the measurement steps and required equipment is provided. In Taiwan, it is strongly recommended that national primary standards laboratory should be established to provide the absorbed-dose-to-water calibration factor (N)for ion chambers to avoid clinical errors and to meet the accuracy in advanced radiation therapy and dosimetry.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1)to indicate specific differences in the techniques between TO-21 and TG-51; and (2) to show the magnitude of the discrepancies in results when following the TG-51 protocol. The discrepancies are compared by different electron energies and chamber types.\\nMaterials and Methods: We use three different ionization chambers ( NE 2581, IC 15 and PPC 35) to measure the output of electron beams.\\nTo compare the values of absorbed dose to water determined according the newest AAPM TO-51 protocol for electron beams of energies from 6 to 21 MeV. The incident electron beams are from the Siemens PRIMUS3008 linear accelerator.\\nResults: The results are found that differences in determined absorbed dose at Dmax by TO-51 protocol vary with electron beam energies and ion chambers. The discrepancies of the ratios are -1.4 %~0.67 %. The dose determined by the NE 2581 chamber is found to be the largest discrepancies than that of the PPC 35 chamber by -1.4 % at 9 MeV. The corresponding results for the IC 15 chamber are -1.26 % at 9 MeV.\\nConclusions: We find that at difference s in determined absorbed dose at dmax according to the TG-51 protocol vary with the characteristics of ion chambers. The absorbed-dose to water calibration factor, N, is an important parameter, too. AAPM TO-21 protocol is based on an exposed (air-kerma) standard and multiple energy-dependent correction factors. The TG-51 protocol is based on an absorbed dose to water calibration factor (ND.IV) and an energy-dependent correction factor, kQ. The quantity of interest is absorbed dose to water in this TO-51 protocol. The overall TG-51 protocol is simpler and easier to understand than the TG-21 protocol.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: The most optimal radiotherapy schedule for palliative irradiation of painful bony metastases remains controversial. This study compares the therapeutic efficacy of two radiotherapy schedules in the management of painful bony metastases.\\nMaterials and Methods: Thirty-six patients with painful bony metastases entered the prospective randomized trial. They were randomized to receive either a single 6Gy treatment (Group 1) or a course of 30Gy in ten daily fractions (Group 2). Every patient had three follow-up visits which included at the beginning of treatment, three days, and one month after completion of the treatment. The efficacy of theses two radiotherapy schedules was evaluated by each visit using a self-scoring questionnaire.\\nResults: There were no significant differences between the two treatment regimens in the degree of pain relief, the duration of pain relief, and the limitation of movement due to metastatic bone pain nor nausea or vomiting. Three days after single 6Gy radiotherapy treatment, the frequency of pain episodes can be reduced significantly (p=0.001) and so do one month later (p=0.003); in addition, these patients had less fatique than patients treated with fractionated radiotherapy (p=0.033).\\nConclusion: A single 6Gy radiotherapy offers a safer, easier, and more effective way to manage metastatic bone pain in a terminal patient with a very short life expectancy.',\n",

To minimize the acute and late adverse effects of liver irradiation and preserve maximal normal liver tissue, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (R/T) is used in our institute.\\nMaterials & Methods: Twenty-three patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with 55Gy in 22 fractions. All patients were assessable for side effects and response.\\nResults: The mean regression of turner volume was 29% at 1 month after completion of R?T, 41% at 2 months and 55% at 3 months. In 17 patients with elevated serum alpha-fetoptein (AFP), 15 (88%) were found to have response in the first month after R/T, 10 (59%) had regression of more than 50% of the original level at the first month after R/T. \\nConclusion: For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, the fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is a feasible modality and deserves further follow-up for outcome and toxicity.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To conduct a pilot study on the feasibility of 3D-conformal radiotherapy on unresectable and unembolizable advanced hepatoma.\\nMaterials and Methods: From November 1996 to March 1998, 16 patients of 15 males and 1 female with median age 62 (range 26-80) were enrolled in this pilot study. All the patients have varying degree of liver cirrhosis. According to Child's classification, 8 patients were in Child' A, 7 in Child's B and I in Child's C. Two patients had diffuse disease, 11 with massive-nodular lesion (＞ = 7cm), 4 with smaller nodular lesion (＜7cm). All patients had their CT images taken at treatment position and contours of the tumor and normal tissues were defined. Tumor volume was bounded with 2cm margin bilaterally, 2.0 to 2.5cm in cranial and caudal direction depending on the extent of respiratory motion. The beam's eye view representation was used for treatment planning. Normal liver was maximally spared outside the target volume and irradiation was administered daily using 10 MV X-rays at 1.8-2Gy per fraction. The percent volume of normal liver irradiated by 50% of target dose or greater (% VNLD50) would determine total dose given.\\nResults: Eight patients had % VNLD50 less than 40 and the median dose given was 60.1Gy (range 49-68Gy). There were 3 PR (partial response), 3 SD (stable disease), 1 CR (complete response) and 1 PD (progressive disease). There were two patients died of fatal radiation hepatitis. Six patients were in the group having 33 to 66 % VNLDSO and median dose was 49.4Gy (range 40-64Gy). There were 4 SD and 2 PD. Two patients suffered from non-fatal radiation hepatitis and 1 patient died of fatal hepatitis. Two patients had %VNLD50 greater than 66. One was SD and another one had PD. One patient died of fatal radiation hepatitis. Median follow-up time was 7 months. Overall response rate was 25%. Median survival was 7 months (range 1-16). Six-month survival rate was 50% and that of 1 2-month was 37.5%.\\nConclusion: Selected cases of hepatoma that has %VNLDSO under 40 can be'considered for 3D-conformal radiotherapy but the correlation of radiation dose and radiation induced liver damage still need further investigation. For cases with % VNLD50 greater than 66, there is no clinical benefit of performing 3D-oonformal radiotherapy.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: Using CT-based simulation as an aid for breast cancer radiotherapy to increase the accuracy of treatment and hope to decrease the rate of lung fibrosis.\\nMaterials and Methods: From July 1994 to January 1999, we retrospectively analyzed 95 patients who received full course radiotherapy with regular follow-up at our department. The average age of the patients was 49 years old, and the median follow-up interval was 26.7 months. A method was devised to simulate patients with breast cancer in the actual treatment position by using a diagnostic CT spiral scanner and a workstation for virtual simulation. It was desired to produce non-divergent tangential beams through the lung at the matching line for tangential and supraclavicular fields. Bach patient was immobilized in an Alpha Cradle cast. Radio-opaque markers were placed on the margins of the fields decided by simulation and CT scan was performed. The data set was transferred to the workstation. After reconstruction of all the images, we performed virtual simulation from computer. When treatment parameters were decided, we would resimulate patient before treatment started. Patients received regular follow-up after completion of radiotherapy. Chest X-ray films were taken to detect lung metastasis and fibrosis while physical examination and chest CT were performed to evaluate local recurrence.\\nResults: All the chest X-ray films were rechecked and 5 patients (5.26%) with lung fibrosis were noted. According to the chart records and CT images, local recurrence was noted in 3 patients (3.16%). Among the 5 patients with lung fibrosis, the average greatest perpendicular distance (GPD) measured from the CT image was 1.75cm, the average irradiated lung volume of the tangential fields was 122.25 mlthat occupied 7% of the ipsilateral lung volume. For the 3 patients with local recurrence, the average GPD was 1.5cm, the average irradiated lung volume within the tangential fields was 155.48 ml, and the average irradiated lung volume was 6.12% of the ipsilateral lung.\\nConclusion: Using CT-based simulation as an aid for breast cancer radiation treatment was more accurate than traditional treatment planning. It provided us the accurate relationship between the position of the target and critical organs. We decrease irradiated lung volume and hope to reduce the chance of lung fibrosis.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study evaluates the usefulness of serial CEA, TPA, CA153 and combined modalities in serum levels for screening recurrence in patients with primary breast cancer after surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: CEA, TPA, and CA153 serial serum determinations were performed on 332 patients (median follow-up: 48.9 months) with primary breast cancer. Within the group, there were 195 clinically diagnosed episodes of relapse during follow- up. Comparison among groups by cut-off value, and dynamic changes of 20% and 30% were done.\\nResults: The sensitivity and specificity, determined for circulating tumor markers by cutoff levels were (for CEA)27.91%, 94.38%; (TPA) 63.37%, 53.13%; and (CM 53) 31.40%, 92.50%, respectively. Utilizing 20% dynamic change methods, CEA, TPA and CA1S3 showed sensitivities of 59.30%, 55.23% and 17.44%, and specificities of 18.75%, 38.13% and 99.38%, respectively.\\nConclusions: In this study, metastatic patients were classified into three categories of sites: viscera, bones and locoregional. Tumor marker sensitivity was clearly related to the site of recurrence; the lowest sensitivity was found in locoregional relapse and the highest was in patients with visceral metastasis, CA153 was more sensitive than CEA in monitoring breast cancer recurrence under cut-off methods but the results were reversed when serum concentration was evaluated by dynamic changes. For single markers, TPA presented the best sensitivity in all fields under cut-off methods, but was surpassed by CEA under dynamic changes for the detection of visceral metastasis. Unlike the other categories, when serum TPA values were determined by dynamic changes, the highest sensitivity was obtained for visceral metastasis detection. Significant elevation predicted new recurrence or tumor regrowth after complete remission. The combined use of CEA, TPA, and CA153 increased the overall sensitivity.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To evaluate and discuss the radietion therapeutic results of Graves' ophthamopathy treated at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH).\\nMaterials & Methods: This retrospective study was to review the 16 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy whom treated with radiation therapy at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1992 to 1997. There were Smen and 8 women, aged from 14 to 63 years old, with a mean age of 42.9 years old. Most of the patients presented with soft tissue signs, eye muscle impairment and proptosis. Patients received 20Gy in 2Gy per fraction to volume that included the entire area of abnormality and usually extended from the posterior globe to the anterior clinoids process.\\nResults: Sixty-three percent (10/16) of the patients responded successfully to radiotherapy. There was 62.5% (10/16) of the patients presenting with these signs demonstrated significant improvement. Patients with proptosis improved after treatment was 83.3% (5/6), respectively. Only 40.0% (4/10) of the patients showed improvement in the restriction of eye movement. Improvement of visual acuity was found in 60.0% (3/5) of the patients.\\nConclusion: Radiotherapy with a dosage of 20Gy is effective in preventing exacerbation of active inflammatory ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves' disease and eliminates the side effects associated with protracted use of corticosteroid. It is recommended that radiotherapy can be considered to treat patients who fail after steroid administration or have a contraindication to steroid. Surgical management such as orbit decompression may reserved for patients who have progressing or disabling proptosis after radiation therapy.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: This study was designed to gain an understanding of the degree to which cancer patients choose to turn to alternative treatment methods, to find out what factors play a role in this preference, and to encourage medical personnel to open their mind to the ergonomic and educational aspects of this tendency towards alternative treatment methods. Consequently, this should lead to a more positive approach to convincing patients to submit to scientific medical treatment and increase their familiarity therewith, so that they can take advantage of both types of treatment when carried out simultaneously.\\nMaterials and Methods The study was carried out at the Linkou Chang Sung Memorial Hospital from November 1, 1997 to November 30, 1999. Eight hundreds and seventy-two patients were entered in the study, being cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy at the hospital's Radiation Oncology Department. Admission was based on a questionnaire that had to be filled in by each patient, in which they were assisted by senior nursing staff of the Radiation Oncology Department. This questionnaire had to be filled in twice, the first time within the first week during radiotherapy and the second time within 6 months after completion of the treatment.\\nResults There were various types of alternative treatments that the studied patients received before or during the radiotherapy course, including folk recipe, breathing exercises, massage, vegetarian food. Among the various types of alternative treatments, diet alternative treatments were most significantly increased during radiotherapy. Therefore, it was understood that the cancer patients thought diet was closely associated with cancer diseases. Of those patients who turned to alternative treatment methods either before or during radiotherapy, most would choose more than one alternative, but mostly in the form of popular treatment methods primarily being the administering of medicinal herbs. One hundred sixty and one patients would recommend such treatments to other patients. Whether or not alternative treatment methods were effective directly influenced the patient's inclination to recommend such treatments to other patients (p＜0.0001). After local radiotherapy, the majority of the studied patients would design health care programs themselves and modify their life styles.\\nConclusion: The intent of the cancer patients to accept the standard treatments such as radiotherapy did not conflict with the intent for them to turn to alternative treatments. Although taking alternative treatments is not recommended, it is not practical to prohibit their use. Considering the vast cost turning to alternative treatments must result in, the medical and nursing staff should help the patients select their alternative treatments seriously in order to lead to economic difficulties and psychophysical affliction. Further large-scale clinical investigations are needed to study whether alternative treatments would influence the effectiveness of the recommended standard treatments or not.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: The percentage depth dose of physical and enhanced dynamic wedge fields of Varian CL-2100 CD linear accelerators were measured. According to the variation of the PDD values, PDD modification effect of both type wedges will be observed and discussed.\\nMaterials and Methods: The PDD curves of open and physical wedged fields were measured with Nucletron 3D water phantom equipped with 0.12 cc Scanditronix RK ionization chamber. The PDD values of enhanced dynamic wedged fields were measured with Keithley 35040 dosimeter connected to Wellhofer Focus PPC-35 parallel plate ionization chamber. The beam energies are 6 and 10 MV. The measured field sizes are 5×5, 10×10, 15×15, 20×20cm^2. The wedge angles are 15°, 30°, 45° and 60°. The depths are surface, the dm, 5, 10, 15, 20cm. Each value were normalized to it's own D(subscript max) to compare the PDD variation.\\nResults: The beam hardening effect of physical wedged field were inverse to beam energy and field size. But increase when the depth and wedge angle increased. The maximum PDD increment (2.23%) is located at 6 MV, 5×5cm^2 field size, 60° wedge angle and depth equal to 20cm. The PDD modification effect of enhanced dynamic wedged field was inverse with beam energy, but increased when the field size, the depth and the wedge angle increased. The maximum PDD increment (1.14%) is located at 6MV, 20×20cm^2 field size, 60° wedge angle and depth equal to 20cm.\\nConclusions: The PDD modification effect of enhanced dynamic wedged field are really exist. The effect from the physical wedge is due to the filtering effect of the wedge material. The effect from the enhanced dynamic wedge is due to the dose-gradient effect.\",\n",

The distance between the source and the surface of water is 100 cm. Transmission factors in water were measured at 5cm depth (6 MV) and 10cm depth (15 MV) of the central axis for four wedge angles (15°, 30°, 45°, 60°) at field sizes ranging from 4.0 to 25.0 cm. Results The transmission factors of physical wedges increase slowly as filed size increase. The mean increment is 4% and the maximum increment is 6%. However, the transmission factors of virtual wedges remain almost constant (1.0) for all the wedge angles. The mean increment is 1.7%, and the maximum increment is 3%.\\nConclusion Transmission factors of all virtual wedges are almost constant It means that the output without a wedge is almost equal to the output with a wedge at the central axis. This tells us the transmission factors are not the primary influence factor on clinical applications of virtual wedge.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: In this study, we will describe the technique details of mounting the new, versatile stereoadapter. In addition, we will research the reproducibility of repeated mounting of that.\\nMaterials and Methods: The stereoadapter5000 is a non-invasive frame made of reinforced plastic and aluminum alloy. It is mounted to patient's head by means of two ear plugs and nasion support. The tight intensity of this frame is modify by a threaded screw at the nasion support, two cogwheel cases joined the lateral triangle components to the nasion support arm, and two ones joined the connector plate to the lateral triangle components. To achieve maximum accuracy and confidence with the stereoadapter, we should repeat the mounting procedure several times to become familiar with all the features of the frame. Besides, the reproducibility of repeat fixations of the frame to the head was tested in 7 healthy volunteers. The differences in location of the marking were measured.\\nResults: The mountings of the frame to the head took 3 mm. All subjects tolerated well the three mountings of the frame. Some complaints were unpleasant pressure on the bridge of the nose and on the external auditory canal and not hear well due to the occlusion of the canal by the ear plugs. About reproducibility of repeat fixation of this frame, the differences in the position of the blocks on the right side was 0.74 mm (SD 0.47 mm, range 1.5 mm), and on the left side was 0.89 mm (SD 0.24 mm, range 1.25).\\nConclusion: This stereoadapter is easy and quick to mount on the patient's head, and reproducibility of repeated mountings is very 4gh. So not limited to single session, the stereotactic irradiation can be fractionated, according to radidbiological principles, in several sessions. In addition to combine with CT and MRI system, this frame is also suitable for open stereotactic surgery.\",\n",

The interaction of hydroxyapatite micron-sized particles (HMP) and the cytotoxicity of RHMP to the hepatoma cells were also studied.\\nMaterials and Methods: The RHMP were synthesized using biocompatible hydroxyapatite and neutron irradiated in Tsing-Hua open pool reactor. Human hepatoma HepG2 cell line was employed for in-vitro evaluation.\\nResults: The main nuclide of the RHMP is P-32. Cell culture tested reveals that hepatoma cells have high affinity to HMP. Tested with 70-100μm HMR the hepatoma cells climbed and surrounded the particles within 3 days. Testing with sub-micron HMP, the particles were endocytosised by hepatoma cells. Cells treated with higher dosages of RHMP showed lower surviving fraction, and cells seemed to have less morphological changes. Meanwhile, cells were treated with lower dosages, changes were observed and the RHMP could be endocytosised by hepatoma cells.\\nConclusion: In-vitro evaluation reveals that the RHMP are highly cytotoxic and are an effective internal radio-therapeutic agent for hepatoma. These results may have major clinical significance in the development of future research in internal radiotherapy.',\n",

All animals were tattooed on the left flank with Indian ink at size of 4×4 cm and a gap of 5cm between the fields. Prior to irradiation the animals were anaesthetized with a gas mixture. Radiation dose was given at 22.5, 25.0 and 27.5Gy using 3MeV electrons. At 14 days after irradiation, a chromometer was used to determined the degree of erythema, the skin samples were taken on the next day after erythema reached the maximum. Only 2×2cm skin samples were cutted, fixed, hydrolysed, stained, connective tissues removed, epidermal sheets prepared and mounted for final colony counting under the microscope. Furthermore, a dose..response curve and D(subscript 0) value were obtained.\\nResults: The maximum AR value were between 5 to 8, this peak value only lasts for about 2 days. Normally the maximum SE value appeared between days 18 to 21. The pattern of the present epidermal microcolonies appears to have dark nuclear stain, regular and compact cellular arrangement with few mitotic cells, which forms strong contrast to the surrounding cells. The D(subscript o) value deduced from the surviving curve was 3.05±0.38Gy.\\nConclusions: The importance of pig skin in radiation research is known for many years by many experts. However, the development of an optimal assay system has to rely on the best combination of the accuracy of radiation dose delivery, optimal sampling time, skin fixation, staining and epidermal sheet separation etc. The present results proved it's superiority and applicability in terms of the assay technique.

The radiation was delivered with 10 or 15 MV X-ray given 5 days per week at 1.8 to 2Gy per fraction. Total doses ranged from 52 to 60Gy. All patients had at least 2 years of follow-up.\\nResults: The 5-year local control rate (LC), overall survival rate (OS), distant metastasis-free rate (DMF) and disease-free survival rate (DFS) for the 95 patients were 49%, 43%, 46% and 35%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the stage (Ⅱ vs. Ⅲ), T stage (T3 vs. T4), N stage (N0 vs. N1 vs. N2) and preoperative CEA (＜5 vs. ≥5ng/ml) were the significant prognostic factors in LC, OS, DMF and DFS. In multivariate analysis, the N stage was the only statistically significant predictor of LC (p=0.0124), OS (p=0.0014), DMF (p=0.0012) and DFS (p=0.0010).\\nConclusion: N stage (the number of involved nodes) is the most important prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy alone. Patients with more than 3 involved nodes had significantly poor treatment outcome. The optimal adjuvant treatment for rectal cancer is still controversial. Further investigation of various treatment modalities is needed.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To compare the effect and toxicity of concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and radiotherapy alone (RT) for advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).\\nMaterials and Methods: A phase III randomized trial was conducted since December 1993. Patients with previously untreated and pathologic diagnosis of NPC were eligible. These included 1)1992 AJCC stage Ⅲ/Ⅳ; 2)Karnofsky scale ＞50%; 3)age ＜80 years old; 4)normal liver, renal, and bone marrow function; 5)no distant metastasis; 6)obtaining informed consent. Radiotherapy was administered in both arms with total dose of 70-75 Gy/6-8 weeks using a similar fractionation and technique. The concomitant chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin + 5-FU continuous intravenous infusion during the first and fifth weeks of radiotherapy.\\nResults: This preliminary analysis included 120 patients who were followed at least 3 years after treatment. It was compatible between the two groups in patients' characteristics. Tumor response were evaluated 2 months after treatment which showed no difference between CRT and RT. Acute toxicity was similar except for leucopenia which occurred more frequently and more severe in CRT arm. But most patients in both arms tolerated the treatment course smoothly. The 4-year primary disease-free, regional disease-free and distant metastasis disease-free survival rates were 91.6% vs. 75.5%, 93.7% vs. 88.8%, and 73.4% vs. 70.7%, respectively in CRT and RT groups. CRT has better local control than RT with a borderline significant difference (P=0.0753). The 4-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 68.6% vs. 53.5% and 70.1% vs. 55.1% respectively, favored CRT groups but the difference was not statistically significant. Distant metastasis was the predominant site of failure in both arms.\\nConclusion: Concomitant chemoradiotherapy is better than radiotherapy alone in local control rate for advanced NPC. However, most patients failed at distant site(s). Adequate and effective neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy before or after radiotherapy to eradicate subclinical micrometastasis should be further consideration.\",\n",

The WELLHOFER WP700 water phantom system with ion chamber was applied to measure the desired angle (α.) of VW. The beam profile data was measured by the Sun Nuclear The Profiler linear array of solid-state detectors.\\nResults: Compared with the 4 commonly-used wedge angles, namely, 15°, 30°, 45° and 60°, the deviation of desired virtual wedge angle for 6 MV and 18 MV photon beam are all within one-and-half degree. For beam profiles, the maximum deviation between VW and HW for 6 MV was 5.0% with wedge angle of 60°, depth of 5cm, and field size of 15×15cm^2. For depth beyond 5cm the maximum deviation between virtual wedge and hard wedge for 18 MV was 5.7% with wedge angle of 60°, depth of 10cm, and field size of 20×20cm^2. However, for depth less than 5cm, the maximum deviation for 18 MV will be as high as 11.1%.\\nConclusions: Due to the different concept and the clinical application of virtual wedge, we need a comprehensive verification data before we apply the virtual wedge technique in the clinics. We also need to set up and practice a quality assurance program for virtual wedge system to assure the treatment quality.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purposes of this paper are to analyze the clinical physical characteristics of virtual wedges for the Siemens PRIMUS 3008 linear acceleratot We focus on the wedge angles, transmission factors and the discrepancies of relative dose distributions between physical and virtual wedges. The data will be used to set up the computer treatment planning database.\\nMaterials and Methods We measure virtual wedge angles and transmission factors by Wellhöfer IC 15, 0.13 cc chamber. The wedge angles are measured at 10cm depth of the central axis, and SSD is 90cm. Transmission factors are measured at 5cm (6 MV) and 10cm (15 MV) depth of central axis, and SSD is 100cm. The relative dose profiles of virtual and physical wedges are measured by Wellhöfer CA24 chamber array. We measure four depths of the central axis (the depth are d(subscript max), 5, 15, 20cm for 6 MV, and d(subscript max), 10, 15, 20cm for 15 MV) for four wedge angles. The chamber is installed on the chamber frame of Wellhöfer water phantom (48×48×40cm^3).\\nResults The different range of virtual wedge angles is below 1.5 degrees between the machine setup and the results measured by ion chamber. The transmission factors of virtual wedges remain almost constant. The relative dose profiles of virtual and physical wedges were not completely the same.\\nConclusion The clinical applications of virtual wedge have convenience for treatment setup, and various arbitrary angle. In order to promote the quality of treatment, the QA program beccmes very important.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare patient setup errors using simulation film and port film in radiation therapy for cervical cancer.\\nMaterials and Methods: Simulation films and port films of 35 patients with cervical cancer are analyzed. Two anatomical landmarks, roof of the acetabulum and symphysis pubis, are used to evaluate the difference between simulation film and port film.\\nResults: Errors in X axis of 31 cases are less than 2mm. Errors in Y axis of 30 cases are less than 4mm. In other words, the error in Y axis is larger than that in X axis.\\nConclusion: Based on the analysis of the data of AP simulation films and AP port films, most of the radiation field deviations are within the range of 0 to 1mm. Therefore, setup errors in our department are acceptable.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To initiate and conduct a weekly chart review program in a radiation oncology department. Its results were analyzed and reported.\\nMethods and Materials: According to the guidelines recommended by the Task Group-40 report, AAPM, a weekly chart review program was initiated. Patients and their charts seen and treated between June 1998 and July 1999 were routinely reviewed once every Friday during their treatment course. Errors, once identfied, were documented, and categorized as calculation (summation), recording, or execution errors. Analyses were also made according to treatment machines and time allocations. Calculation errors were rated according to the discrepancy between the dose actually delivered and prescribed.\\nResults: A total of 9425 charts were reviewed. Of these, 172 errors were identified, accounting for an incidence of 1.8% (172/9425). Of these, 45.3% (78/172), 52.3% (90/172), 2.4% (4/172) errors were due to calculation, recording, and execution, respectively. Dose discrepancy in 78% of patients was less than or equal to 5%. Error distributions by treatment machine were 23.8%, 23.8%, 16.9%, 28.5%, and 7%, for Li through L5, respectively. The most frequent time allocation that errors occurred was 3-4 PM, accounting for 20% of total errors.\\nConclusion: A weekly chart review program is an integrated part of quality assurance in a modem radiation oncology department. A substantial proportion of treatment errors can be effectively detected with aid of this program.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: In this study 5-fluorouracil (5FU), ionizing radiation or combination of both was applied on human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (SW480) in order to establish a better therapeutic strategy for clinical use.\\nMaterials and Methods: Log-phase SW480 cells were used for all experiments. For 5FU treatment alone, cells were treated with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1-0, 1.5 and 2.0mM 5FU for 3 hours. For radiation treatment alone, cells were irradiated for 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 4 and 6Gy. For combined treatment, cells were treated with 0.2mM 5FU and graded radiation doses using concurrent treatments or different order of sequence. Surviving fractions of cells were assayed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl-terazolium bromide (MTT) method. Activity of thymidylate synthase and intracellular glutathione contents were also measured.\\nResults: The surviving fractions of SW480 cells were about 40% after three-hour treatments of 0.5mM, 1mM or 2mM 5FU. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) obtained from survival curve is about 0.4mM. Pre-irradiation 0.2mM 5FU treatment, post-irradiation 0.2mM 5FU treatment, and concurrent treatment of 0.2mM 5FU and radiation all had synergistic effect. However, the concurrent treatment of 5FU and radiation was found with the highest killing effect among the three different combined treatments. After 1mM and 2mM 5FU treatments for three hours, contents of reduced glutathione were 6.2±1.5nmole/mg and 5,2±2.6nmole/mg, respectively, and were significantly reduced (p＜ 0.05) as compared to 12±0.4nmole/mg of the control group. Contents of oxidized glutathione were 29.6±5.5nmole/mg and 29.8±2.7nmole/mg, respectively, and were significantly increased (p＜0.05) as compared to 20.5±3.0 amok/mg of the control group. Also, activities of thymidylate synthase were reduced to 0.59 ± 0.04pmole/min/mg and 0.36±0.15pmole/min/mg, respectively, as compared to 2.7±0.76pmole/min/mg of the control group, p＜0.01.\\nConclusions: Concurrently combined 5FU with ionizing radiation showed the highest killing effect on SW480 human colorectal carcinoma cells. Reduced glutathione was significantly decreased in 5W480 cells after 1mM and 2mM 5FU treatments for 3 hours. The finding that the treatment of low concentration (0.2mM) 5FLJ with low doses of ionizing radiation (1Gy, 1.5Gy and 2Gy) still showed synergistic killing effect may have feasible clinical application in fractionated radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy for human colorectal carcinoma.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: We studied colchicine to determine whether or not it can reduce the survival of irradiated human hepatoma HA22T/VGH cells.\\nMaterials and Methods: Twenty four hours after treatment of 0-8ng/ml colchicine, HA22T/VGH cells were irradiated with various doses. Seventy five hours later, the MTT[(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide)] assay was performed to assess cell viability. Before radiation, the percentage of mitosis was calculated and micrographs were taken for morphological observation.\\nResults: Colohicine at a low concentration of 8ng/ml enhanced the growth-inhibiting effect of radiation (up to 10-folds compared to 2Gy radiation alone). We also noted a parallel effect of colchicine on increasing the percentage of mitosis of cells before radiation. Cells treated with colchicine became rounded, floated up and showed mitotic features under observation by an inverted light microscope.\\nConclusion: These findings suggest that colchicine has potential as an adjunct to radiotherapy for hepatoma.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: For reporting the preliminary result of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treated with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery.\\nMaterials and Methods: From June 1994 through April 1998, 26 patients with brain AVM received stereotactic radiosurgery. The age of patients ranged from 12 to 77 years old (median: 28.5). We used 6 MV X-ray Siemens linear accelerator. The median prescribed dose was 15 Gy (range: 10-18.73 Gy) to the nidus margin. The minimal dose ranged from 4.62 to 15.13 Gy (median 11.88 Gy). The maximal dose ranged from 13.33 to 27.95 Gy (median 18.84 Gy). The mean target volume was 6.85 cm^3 (range: 0.63-25.76). Twenty-two patients were treated with one isocenter (4-6 arcs), 4 patients with 2 isoeenters (6-10 arcs). We evaluated the response rate and radiation-induced complication.\\nResults: The follow-up angiogram or MRI studies in 21 patients revealed the complete obliteration rates in 1 and 2 years were 33% and 41%, respectively. With the minimal dose of≤13 and＞ 13 Gy, the 2-year complete obliteration rate was 17% and 60%, respectively (p = 0.0067). The 2-year complete obliteration rate was 44% and 34% with target volume ≤6 and ＞ 6 cm^3 (p = 0.6507), respectively. Higher ratio (＞85%) of minimal dose to prescribed dose was noted in 73% (11/15) and 27% (3/11) of the patients whose target volume was ≤6 and ＞6 cm^3 (p = 0.02), respectively. In multivariate analysis, minimal dose was an only significant factor for complete obliteration (p = 0.0495). One patient had hemorrhage 5 months after radiosurgery. Two patients had radiation-induced complications on MRI 14 to 21 months later after radiosurgery.\\nConclusion: Target volume and minimal dose may influence the obliteration rate of brain AVM. According to literature review, the complete obliteration rates in our series were lower than some reports. Lower prescribed doses may be the cause. Higher doses may improve the response rate.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To simulate the single beam depth and radial dose distribution for the 18 mm collimator of a Gamma Knife radiosurgery unit.\\nMaterials and Methods: EGS4 Monte Carlo code was used to simulate the single beam passing a polystyrene phantom.\\nResults: Simulation results show no difference in the relative dose distributions for point and body sources, it is desirable to use a point source to replace the real body source for all the simulations in this study to reduce computation time. The simulated relative depth dose distribution show good agreement with that calculated by the treatment planning system (GammaPlan (superscript ®)) provided by the manufacturer except at the region adjacent to phantom surface. The simulated relative radial dose distributions at various depths also indicate that the assumption made by the GammaPlan to use the radial dose distribution at the focus to replace those at other depths generates only minimum errors.\\nConclusions: Excluding the build up effect on depth dose distribution at the surface region, GanmiaPlan (superscript ®) show a good agreement with EGS4 simulation both on depth and radial dose distribution in a homogeneous phantom for single beam of gamma knife.',\n",
       " 'Objective: The goal of this study was to analysis and characterize the agent of rhenium-188-Sn-1, 1-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate in radionuclide therapy for Nuclear Medicine.\\nMaterials and Methods: We use the generator of W-188/Re-188 to do some research, because we cooperated with researchers of Institute of Nuclear Energy Research. There are the generators of W-188/Re-188 from Oak Ridge National Laboratory in U.S.A.. First, We synthesize and identify the rhenium-186-1, 1-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate in different condition, then to analyte (including in different conditions) and proceed the biodistribution of the agent of rhenium-188-Sn-1, 1-hydroxyethylidcnc diphosphonate. Results and Discussions: In this study, we found that the main components were five peaks by the analytical method of TSK G2000 PW size exclusion gel in HPLC and their charge is between -1 and -3. The same main components are five peaks by the analytical method of Amine A28 in HPLC and their charge is between -3 and -12 in different proportions.\\nConclusion: We found that the component was only one in the high pH of the rhenium-188-Sn-l, 1-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate, and the components increased more and more when the concentration of hydrogen ion increased. The contents of the components are also dependent on the ratio of the ligand and reduced agent.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Measuring the photoncutron contamination of 15 MV X-ray emitted from Siemens PRIMUS linear accelerator as to be the reference of radiation safety management.\\nMaterials and Methods: This research includes four parts of measurements. (1) Portable neutron remmeter (Harwell Co. N91) which calibrated through shadow cone method is used for environmental survey in the vicinity of treatment room. (2) Neutron detection module, including BF3 proportional counter encased by 9 inch or 3 inch diameter polystyrene (Ph) sphere, is used for mean neutron energy distribution measurement in treatment room. (3) Neutron activation analysis of gold (Au) foil which is irradiated in the X rays field is administrated to determinate neutron contamination. (4) Powder P205 is used to measure the thermal and fast neutron flux in the X rays field.\\nResults and Discussion: Neutron dose equivalent rate in the points of measurement near the treatment room is under the detection limit and is in the range of≦0.04μSv/h. The distribution of mean energy of neutrons from the isocenter of 1, 2, 3 and 5 m are 0.50, 0.20, 0.18 and 0.17 MeV, respectively in treatment room. Thermal and fast neutron flux at isocenter are 1.258 ×10^5 n cm^(-2) s^(-1)and 1.745× l0^4 n cm^(-2) s^(-1), respectively. The Q value is less than 2.17×10^11 neutron per Gy.\\nConclusion: The quantity of photoneutron in the 15 MV X-ray beam of Siemen PRIMUS linear accelerator is not negligible and is in considerable level of shielding design. The shielding structure of this treatment room is effective for photoneutron shielding.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The aim of this experiment is to solve the problem of lack of skin sparing in electron beam therapy and to increase the tolerance of skin to radiation by using grid technique.\\nMaterials and methods: The method of the electron grid therapy is to place a cerrobend grid on the end of an electron cone. Film dosimetry was used to measure the relative surface optical density and depth profile of grided electron beam with energies of 6 to 14 MeV. Different grid hole diameters (d=0.45, 1.0, 1.5 cm) and grid spaces (s=0.4, 0.2 cm) were investigated for each electron energy.\\nResults: Our results indicate that electron grid therapy can decrease the relative surface optical density at various electron energies. The degradations of the relative surface optical density depend on the percentage of open area of the grid portal. The cerrobend grid with 1.5 cm diameter holes and grid space 0.2 cm could conform to the demands of clinical radiotherapy. With this design we could decrease the surface dose and the range of nonhomogeneous dose be limited to a depth so that the target volume could receive a homogeneous dose.\\nDiscussion: Grid technique can lessen the surface dose in electron beam radiotherapy indeed. We would delivery of high radiation dose with electron beams without damaging the skin by grid technique.',\n",
       " 'Mycosis fungoides is a rare T-cell lymphoma, but it accounts for about half of all cases of cutaneous 7-cell lymphoma. Radiation has long been used to treat patients with this radiosensitive disease. However, a significant proportion of patients present with generalized plaques or recurrence of lesions outside or even within the previously irradiated area, it challenged radiotherapists for decades how to irradiate skin (the superficial layer of a somewhat ”cylinder-like” human body) with not only larger field and higher dose but also tolerable toxicity. Radiation with low energy electrons generated by modern linear accelerators, depositing their energy within limited depth could spare deeper tissues. The six-dual-field technique, which provide more satisfying dose distribution for these requirements was developed at Stanford University three decades ago. Since then, the patients treated with total skin electron beam radiation would have better clinical response and minor toxicity.\\nWe adopted the six-dual-field technique to treat a 49-year-old male with generalized plaques. The source-to-surface distance was extended to be 323 cm, and an acrylic beam spoiler was installed to scatter the beam and attenuate the electron energy. The resulting electron energy was 2.62 MeV, generated by a 6 MeV Linac, the output of which was degraded to deliver 0.0648 cGy/MU (at the depth of maximum dose, d(subscript max). The collimator was fully opened to 40×40 cm^2 without a cone. The hinge angle of the dual-field was determined to be 20 degrees. The measured multiplication factor was 2.68. We prescribed a tumor dose at 5 mm depth beneath the skin surface (90% isodose profile). Overall, 1212 MU were required for each field. Beam flatness was within ±5% and ±10% in the vertical and horizontal dimensions, respectively. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to evaluate dose homogeneity at 45 sites. Individualized boost or shielding was used at appropriate sites. Radiation therapy was administered for 4 consecutive days per week, with 2 days constituting a treatment cycle. On the first day of a cycle, half of the 6 dual-fields were irradiated, with the other half treated the other day A total dose of 36 Gy over 18 cycles was given with a fraction dose of 2 Gy. A 10-day midway break was given. The skin lesions responded well to this regimen, and itching was completely relieved prior to completion of the first half of the treatment course. Side effects (marked dermatitis of palms and soles and total hair loss) were acceptable. The patient refused subsequent adjuvant therapy.\\nDespite total skin radiation can achieve good initial clinical outcome, the management of patients with mycosis fungoides is still challenging. This disease has a predisposition to relapse, and the chance is dismal to cure patients with the disease beyond limited plaque stage for the time being. In additicn to radiation therapy, a variety of modalities have been in clinical use or in investigation. We suppose combination treatment should be administered in these patients to improve long-term control.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The dosage of radiotherapy to the pelvis is always limited by the tolerance of small bowel. This study is to evaluate the dose volume histogram (DVH) of the irradiated bowel volume by prone position with belly board in comparison to treatment in supine position technique. Two patients with rectal cancer were analyzed.\\nMaterials and Methods: Two groups of sequential computerized tomography (CT) scans were performed with 8-mm slice thickness for each patient. One group of the scans was obtained for patient with a belly board in a prone position, and the other one was in a supine position for comparing the bowel irradiation volume with the previous scan. Hard copies of CT scan slices for both patients were produced. The contours of small bowel volumes were outlined on each CT slice hard copy and the information was then digitized and entered into treatment planning computer. The cumulative and the differential DVHs were performed for evaluating the bowel irradiation volume.\\nResults: The cumulative DVH, which is used in assessing potential damage to normal tissue, shows that from 70% to 95% of the percentage dose in prone position has a 15% to 18% volume reduction compared to supine position. The differential DVH, which is useful in assessing uniformity of dose to tumors. shows that the irradiated bowel volume has been moved to a region of rower percentage dose.\\nConclusion: Displacement of bowel loops out of the true pelvis is done by using a belly board in the prone position for thin and obese patients instead of supine position to decrease the volume of the intestine under irradiation because of external compression. The pelvic board and a half-body cast can be applied to immobilize patient for precise positioning and repositioning throughout the entire treatment.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To report a rare case of brainstem immature teratoma treated by post-operative limited-field radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: A 21-year-old female presented with symptoms and signs of recurrent aspiration pneumonia that was caused by dysphagia. She had two episodes of acute respiratory arrest and hypotension while in the hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed a heterogenous mass at lower brain stem region. Microscopic surgery only could yielded a piece of tumor that disclosed the entity of immature teratoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy with the regimen of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin was administered, but was interrupted due to sudden onset of respiratory arrest. In order to maintain brainstem function, limited-field irradiation with 39.6 Gy to planning target volume followed by a boost dose to the primary site by stereotactic radiotherapy were performed with a total dose of 54.6 Gy. Two weeks after radiotherapy, the patient began receiving monthly adjuvant chemotherapy for 4 cycles up to the time of this report.\\nResults: Previously elevated serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of both alpha-fetoprotein and beta human-chorionic gonadotropin returned to a normal range after irradiation. The swallowing reflex gradually improved and the patient did not develop aspiration pneumonia again even after the NG tube was removed. Brainstcm function has remained stable following irradiation.\\nConclusion: Our limited experience suggests that limited field radiotherapy followed by a boost dose with stereotactic radiotherapy is very effective in treating brainstem immature teratoma for both local tumor control and relief of life-threatening symptoms.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: To investigate the quantitative changes in bone after localized Cobalt-60 irradiation (IR) using biochemical assay and well-established histomorphometric analysis and the mechanisms of irradiation-induced bone loss.\\nMaterials and Methods: Forty 8-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into control and irradiated (IR) groups. Five rats of each group were sacrified at 1, 7, 14 or 28 days after 12 Gy of localized Cobalt-60 irradiation on right femur and tibia. The parameters of bone formation and bone resorption, and the mechanism of IR on bone were evaluated using biochemical bone marker assay [measuring the concentrations of serum-alkaline phosphatase and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)], and the static and dynamic bone histomorphometry.\\nResults: Seven days after localized cobalt-60 irradiation, there were significant increases in TRAP, nuclei/OC and resorption surface, and decreases in OB/mm^2. A significant decrease in OC/mm^2 occurred 14 days after irradiation. In addition, OC/mm^2, nuclei/OC and resorption surface returned to normal on day 28. No significant difference were found in percent hard tissue, percent bone, trabecular thickness, trabecular mineral apposition and trabecular bone formation between the irradiated and untreated normal control group one day after irradiation. However, they became significantly less on day 7 and began to resume on the day 28 after irradiation.\\nConclusion: Localized Cobalt-60 irradiation could significantly increase nuclei/osteoclast, TRAP activity and resorption space. In addition, it significantly decrease osteoprogenitor cell proliferation, osteoblastic activity and mineralization, and induce dramatic bone loss. In conclusion, Cobalt-60 irradiation could result in osteopenia.',\n",

There were 31 male and 15 female patients. Patient's age ranges between 43 and 82 years. (median: 67). Sixteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy with dosages of 48.6 to 60 Gy (median: 55) to the tumor bed. Fourteen patients received 2 to 12 courses (median: 4) of post-operative chemotherapy using regimens of MVEC (methotrexate, vinblastine, epirubicin, cisplatin) or MCV (methotrexate, cisplatin, vinblastine). Twenty, 21, 5 patients were pathologically staged as T2, T3, T4 (AJCC, 1992), respectively. Four patients had lymph node metastasis pathologically. Twenty four patients had tumor confined to ureter only.\\nResults: Follow-up duration ranges from 5 to 65 months (median: 32). Overall, 7 patients (15%) developed local recurrence and 16 patients (35%) developed distant metastasis. Overall 5-year survival rate (5 YSR) was 19%, and 5-year disease-free survival rate (5 DFS) was 16%. Negative lymph nodes metastasis and the ureteral tumor only were statistically significant good factors for 5 YSR and 5 DFS. 5 YSR for surgery alone group, post-operative radiotherapy group and post-operative chemotherapy group were 16%, 12% and 37% respectively (p=0.43). 5 DFS for the aforementioned treatment arms were 15%, 10% and 27% respectively (p=0.37). No severe complications were observed in patients with post-operative radiotherapy. Three out of the 4 patients with lymph node metastasis developed distant metastasis and died. Eight patients had second location tumors, all of which occurred in the bladder.\\nConclusions: This study showed relative high incidences of patients developing distant metastasis regardless of treatment arms was given. Negative lymph node metastasis and the ureteral tumor only were good factors for 5 YSR and 5 DFS. The post-operative chemotherapy group had a higher 5 YSR and 5 DFS than the other treatment groups, and the results need further confirmation although it was not statistically significant.\",\n",

There were 35 male patients and 5 female patients. The age of the patients ranged from 14 to 78 years old. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 172 months. Medical histories, laboratory and X-ray examinations and modalities of treatment from medical records of each patient were reviewed. Five patients received chemotherapy alone, 19 patients received radiotherapy alone and 16 patients received radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy or surgery.\\nResults: The 5-year disease-free survival rate of all patients was 35%. The 5-year disease-free survival rate for patients receiving radiotherapy alone was 57%. It was 19% for patients treated with radiotherapy plus surgery, chemotherapy or both; and 8% only for patients received surgery combined with other treatments. Number of involved sites (=1), Karnofsky scale (＞70), non-surgery treatment are positive statistical prognostic factors. There were 23 patients died and 9 of them have evidence of disease progression (5 cases of distant metastasis and 4 cases of locoregional recurrence). There were 2 patients relapsed in 15 patients who received chemotherapy, and there were 7 patients relapsed in 25 patients who without chemotherapy.\\nConclusion: Polymorphic reticulosis had excellent local control rate by radiotherapy.

       " 'Purpose: To retrospectively analyze the feasibility, toxicity and outcome of definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for patients with resectable head and neck cancers.\\nMaterials and Methods: Thirty patients with resectable head and neck cancers were treated with definitive split-course radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy. One patient had stage I, 4 stage II, 3 stage Ⅲ and 22 stage IV diseases. Radiotherapy was given once daily or twice daily with total dose of 68-74 Gy. Chemotherapy included 2 cycles with CDDP+/-SFIJ during radiotherapy, and 2 cycles with CDDP+5FU after radiation treatment. Survival outcome was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were determined by log-rank test.\\nResults: The median follow-up time was 50.8 months. The 4-year overall survival, disease-free survival and locoregional control rates were 55.7%, 64.9% and 75.8%, respectively. Treatment-related toxicities were tolerable. T1/T2 diseases were associated with heifer locoregional control (p=0.03). The presence of residual disease on post-treatment MRI or CT was the prognostic factor for overall survival (p=0.05), disease-free survival (p=0.009) and locoregional recurrence-free survival (p=0.0001).\\nConclusion: Definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy can be an alternative to radical surgery for patients with resectable head and neck cancers, with acceptable toxicity and outcome. The presence of residual disease on post-treatment imaging studies demands further investigation and possibly salvage treatment.',\n",

The dosimetric property of resin, a major component of obturator or prosthesis, is investigated.\\nMaterials and Methods: The heterogeneity dose correction factor (HDCF) is introduced and defined as Di/Dh where Di is the dose at heterogeneous condition and Dh is dose of the same point in a homogenous phantom. Dose perturbation for varying sizes of cubic air-filled and resin-filled cavity were examined for 6 and 10 MV photon beams along the beam direction for both proximal side (entering the cavity) and distal side (leaving the cavity).\\nResults: Significant underdosage (more than 30%) can occur on the distal interface when the field size is equal to or less than the air cavity size, especially for higher energy photon beams. The HDCF increases with the increase in field sizes and can be greater than 1 unity, which indicates the possibility of overdosage, but it will remain constant afterwards. A buildup region is observed at the downstream measurements. Underdose phenomenon at the proximal air-phantom interface remains over a wide range of field sizes, but it is less significant (＜10%). The use of resin as the cavity tilling material will dramatically reduce the dose perturbation to within 2.5% on both interfaces, compared with a homogeneous condition.\\nConclusion: With an air cavity embedded in the treatment volume and under the condition of electron equilibrium of pre-cavity medium, the dose measured at interface and subsequent tissue is influenced by the relationship between the field size and cavity size, and also between the cavity shape and photon beam energy. Loss of scattered electron and increase of unattenuated photon beam balance it. Well designed planning with sufficient field size from proper energy beam is recommended. Resin can be used to fill the cavity for improving the dose distribution.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the currently documented models for prediction of radiation -induced liver disease (RILD), for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: From September 1994 to October 1998, four patients with HCC developed FOLD within 3 months after completion of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. All patients had CT simulation with the images including the entire liver. The detailed information from the dose-volume histogram (DVH), including V(subscript 30Gy), V(subscript 50%) V (subscript off) and prediction score (PS), were calculated and assessed. The complication probabilities were compared with several documented models.\\nResults: Two patients died of RILD-related hepatic failure and 2 recovered. Two patients had more than half of the liver with ＞ 30 cay survived but the other 2 patients died of RILD with 40% and 23% of the liver receiving ＞ 30 Gy. Three of 4 patient had the recommended doses of radiation based on the calculated V(subscript 60%). According to the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model, the complication probabilities were less than 5% and within 5-20% if 0.69 and 0.32 were applied for the volume effect parameters, respectively.\\nConclusion: All the currently documented models fail to accurately estimate the probability of FOLD for the 4 patients with HCC treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. It is indicated to establish a model for patients with HCC in Taiwan, using the currently available fractionation and the information from the DVH.',\n",

The Co-60 unit will move to another compartment. Since the higher radiation energy of linacs and new arrangement of the treatment room, the previous shielding including the thickness of barriers and lead door, the length of maze ....etc, need be re-evaluated. Calculations are based on NCRP49, 51, 33, 102, ICRP60 and AEC dose constraint, and the results show the shielding deficiency on ceiling, maze and lead door.

       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the result of conventional radiation treatment for prostate cancer, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients referred to our department from 1982 to 1996.\\nMaterial and Methods: From 1982 to 1996, a total of 240 prostate cancer patients were referred to our department for radiotherapy (RT). Only 73 patients who had disease confined to the pelvis (stage A-D1) and completed the RT treatment were entered into this analysis. The median age was 67 years (range 53-78) and the median follow-up time was 38.5 months (range 7.8 -124.3). For convenience for comparison, we divided those patients into two groups for final analysis: group I - curative RT alone, 64 patients; group II - radical prostatectomy followed by adjuvant RT, 9 patients. Radiotherapy was delivered by conventional two-dimensional treatment plan. External irradiation was usually given by 10 or 15 MV X-ray to the pelvis and then coned down to the prostate and seminal vesicle, yielding a total dose of 4400 to 8400 cGy (mean 6638 cGy) for group I patients and 5600 to 6800 cGy (mean 5956 cGy) for group II patients. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormone therapy was given in 33 patients.\\nResults: Grade II acute gastrointestinal (01) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity were observed in 28 (38%) and 18 (25%) patients, respectively. There were one patient with acute grade III 01 toxicity and another patient with acute grade III GU toxicity. Late morbidity analysis was only available in 66 patients. Severe late complications including fistula formation, urethral stricture, cystitis, proctitis were found in 9 patients (14%) which is higher than other reported series. Those patients who received RT after radical prostatectomy experienced a significant higher severe late complication rate than those who received RT alone. (44% vs 9%, p＜0.05). The overall survival rates for all patients are 67% at 5 years and 36% at 10 years. The cause-specific survivals for all patients are 66% at 5 years and 34% at 10 years. The local control rates are 83% for stage A and B, 90% for stage C and 50% for stage Dl patients in group I. The local control rate for group II patients is 100%. In univariate analysis, age, stage, pathology grading, hormone therapy and RT dose didn’t show significant impact on cause specific survivals.\\nConclusion: This study showed the local control rates after curative RT or radical prostatectomy followed by adjuvant RT are good. However, the complication rates after conventional two-dimensional RT are high. Further efforts in three-dimensional conformal RT for prostate cancer is highly recommended in term of decreasing toxicity.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To study the impact of preoperative irradiation on enhancing sphincter preservation and to evaluate the treatment outcome in patients with lower rectal cancer. The results were analyzed for the endpoints of sphincter preservation, sphincter function, pelvic control, disease-free survival, overall survival and treatment-related morbidities.\\nMaterials and Methods: From 1992 to 1996, 43 patients with clinically resectable rectal cancer received preoperative radiotherapy at our department. All of these patients had undergone a prospective clinical assessment by their surgeons and were declared to require an abdominoperineal resection due to the proximity of the tumor to the anal sphincter. The whole pelvis received 37.5 Gy in daily fraction of 2.5 Gy with parallel opposed anterior-posterior portals.\\nResults: Thirty of the forty-three patients (70%) were able to undergo low anterior resection. The majority (88%) of patients had good sphincter function after sphincter-preserving surgery. The pathologic stage was T2 in 11 patients and T3 in 32 patients. The 3- year overall survival rate, disease-tree survival rate, and local control rate of the 43 patients were 60%, 62%, and 89%, respectively. In univariate analysis, pathologic stage and the presence of regional lymphadenopathy were noted as significant prognostic factors for both overall survival and disease-free survival. With regard to local control, only the presence of regional lymphadenopathy showed prognostic significance for local control. No difference in survival rate and local control rate was observed between patients undergoing low anterior resection and those undergoing abdominoperineal resection. In multivariate analysis, pathologic stage was noted as the only independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival; likewise, only the presence of lymphadenopathy was demonstrated as an independent predictor for local control. No clinical and pathologic parameters were proved to be independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Acute intestinal toxicity included grade 1 in 10 (23%) patients, grade 2 in 18 (42%) patients, and grade 3 in 2 patients (5%). No patients had acute urological toxicity.\\nConclusion: With the help of preoperative radiotherapy, a significant proportion of patients would have a chance to receive sphincter-preserving surgery. Furthermore, the preserved sphincter functioned well in most of the patients. Further efforts should be made to reduce the treatment-related morbidities.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate treatment results and analyze pathological prognostic factors in surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone for hypopharyngeal cancer.\\nMaterials and Methods: This retrospective analysis is based on the clinical outcome of 81 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer treated with surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone from January 1987 to December 1997. There were 79 males and 2 females, between 24 and 80 years old (median: 54). The numbers of patients in stages I to IV were 0, 3, 22 and 56, respectively. There were no significant difference in T- and N-distributions between the two treatment groups. Radiotherapy alone was used in 18 patients with 1.8 Gy pen fraction per day to a mean total dose of 63.9 Gy (range 34.2 to 75.6 Gy). Surgical treatment for 63 patients consisted of total laryngectomy with partial or total pharyngectomy and esophagectomy when indicated. These patients received ad]uvant radiotherapy to a mean dose of 60.4Gy (range 36 to 73.8 Gy).\\nResults: The 5-year survival rates were 33% for patients treated with surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy and 30% for patients treated with radiotherapy alone. There was no significant difference in survival between the two treatment groups. The local control rate at 5 years was 52% for patients treated with surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy, compared with 40% for patients treated with radiotherapy alone with a significant difference (p = 0.015). Multivariate analysis identified that perineural invasion and necrosis are the significant predictors of poorer survival.\\nConclusion: The combination of surgery plus radiotherapy results in a better locoregional control than radiotherapy alone, but dose not yield a better survival. Perineural invasion and necrosis are associated with poorer survival.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To determine the efficacy of recombinant interferon alfa-2b (Intron A) (rIFN) in the treatment of primary untreated undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) before radiotherapy and to determine the efficacy and feasibility of combined rIFN and radiotherapy concomitantly.\\nMaterial and Patients: Fourteen patients enrolled in this study. All of them had histologically proved locally advanced NPC. Patients received rIFN subcutaneous injection with dose of 3 x 10^8 U/body, three times a week for a median of 6 weeks. Then rIFN was continued during the following 7 weeks’ radiotherapy period with the same dose and schedule. Radiotherapy consisted of 70 Gy of boo-regional irradation with conventional fractionation. Toxicities and response were evaluated. A long follow-up report was performed.\\nResults: There was no observed response from neoadjuvant rIEN treatment in 13 evaluable patients. Twelve of them received scheduled radiotherapy as well as rIFN treatment. All of them had rapid tumor shrinkage, 10 of them (83%) had complete response after radiotherapy. The oropharyngeal mucositis (≧grade 3) toxicity was quite substantial, and most patients had been forced to interrupt to radiotherapy course. There were two patients with locally failure and 6 had distant metastases. The median survival for those 12 patients who received complete course of treatment was 26 months (range: 20-140+months).\\nDiscussion: Interferon single agent is not effective in NPC therapy. The combined use of rlFN and radiotherapy has resulted in a higher oropharyngeal mucositis rate from the radiosensitization effect of rIFN, but it does not translate to a higher local control rate nor lower distant failure rate. The benefit of adjunctive use of rIFN is not evident from this small series of study. In viewing of the better tolerance of rIFN than chemotherapy by most patients, the radiosensitization effect of rIFN can be further studied and explored.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: It got no consensus about the therapy of low grade glioma, especially for the low grade astrocytoma. We have retrospectively reviewed the results of radiotherapy for low grade astrocytoma, and define the role of postoperative radiotherapy in the treatment of low grade astrocytoma. Materials and Methods: From 1979 to 1988, 46 adult patients with low grade astrocytoma received postoperative radiotherapy in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou Medical Center. The median age of these patients was 32 years old with the range from 15 to 63. There were 25 male and 21 female. According to the Kernohan's grading system, 10 patients' tumors belonged to grade 1 and the others belonged to grade 2. Eleven patients received total removal of tumors, 17 patients received subtotal excision of tumors, and 18 patients received biopsy only. All patients had good performance status (Karnofsky scale ＞ 70) after operation. For radiotherapy, the median total dose was 6000 cGy on each patient, ranging from 4400 to 6600 cGy. No patient received chemotherapy at the beginning.\\nResult: The overall 5 year survival was 49%. Female had better survival than male (54% vs 24%, p=O.O15). Younger patients had better results than older patients (47% vs 30%, p0.04). Patients with grade I tumors had better survival than patients with grade Ii tumors (69% vs 30%, p=O.O4). Patients received excision surgery had better survival rate (44% vs 32 %, p=0.05), but the extent of surgery did not make the difference. Total radiation dose did not significantly change the survival result. \\nDiscussion: The low grade astrocytoma patients showed poor survival rate after radiotherapy, especially for patients with grade II tumor. To properly treat patients with low-grade astrocytorma is a more important issue than to consider the incidence of radiation complications.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To re-evaluate the appropriateness of thoracic radiotherapy (AT) for patients with advanced non-small coil lung cancer (NSCLC).\\nMaterials and Methods: This retrospective study included 89 patients with advanced NSCLC registered in Mackay Memorial Hospital from July 1992 to Juno 1997. Thoracic RT was given with radical or palliative intent depending on the stage and/or performance status at diagnosis to 63 (the AT group) but had withheld in 26 (the non-AT group). The total dose to the primary tumor was in the range of 5000-6000 cGy at 180 cGy per fraction over 5-6.5 weeks. Tumor control was strictly defined as complete disappearance of tumor on all radiographic examinations and/or no evidence of disease clinically at the last follow up.\\nResults: No survival advantage was noted in the AT group compared to the non-AT group (median 3.0 vs. 5.5 months). The mean survival time of patients with stage Ill disease was 11.37 ± 1.94 months and median survival time was 8 months. The control rate in the AT group was poor with only 4 of 63 (6%) disease-free on the last follow up. One of four patients who were disease-free died of radiation pneumonitis about 3 months after complete of AT. In addition, one patient with stage lllb was still alive, undergoing chemotherapy for distant metastasis.\\nConclusion: Thoracic RT did not prolong survival for patients with locally advanced NSCLC.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: To evaluate and quantify the accuracy using a new custom-made pelvis immobilization device during the course of radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: A new custom-made pelvic immobilization cast had been developed to provide a stable and comfort position of the patients. It consists of a flat and rigid acrylic plate and thermoplastic cast. Eight patients with pelvic cast were evaluated by on line electronic portal imaging during daily radiotherapy treatment for 5 to 8 consecutive days. While another 10 patients without pelvic casts were used as a control. A total of 221 electronic portal imaging (EPI) were reviewed. Under the assistance of image registration software, the geometric errors from the EPI was identified by interactive techniques. The systematic and random setup errors for each patient were determined.\\nResults: Daily set-up variation was markedly improved using the cast. The total directed setup errors for all patients in anterior-posterior (AP), left-right (LR) and inferior-superior (IS) directions were -0.1±2.2 mm, -0.4±1.2 mm and -0.3 ±2.0 mm respectively with cast as compared to -0.4±2.4 mm, 1.2±1.9 mm and -1.1±3.8 mm respectively without cast. The suggested margin, which was calculated according to the total undirected setup error for each patient, in AP/PA and lateral fields for more than 5 mm were found in 14% and 33% of patients with casts as compared to 60% and 89% of patients without immobilization cast. (p value = 0.065 for AP/PA fields and p value = 0.024 for lateral fields)\\nConclusion: This custom-made pelvic immobilization cast appears to improve the reproducibility of patient setup during radiotherapy for pelvic tumors. In application to 3-D conformal radiotherapy, this type of immobilization is now routinely used in our department and is recommended for all patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy.',\n",

Because the thickness of head and anterior portion of neck may be different, our study is to evaluate the dose nonuniformity within target volume and to introduce a simple application model of tissue compensator to improve the dose nonuniformity for the bilateral treatment.\\nMaterials and methods: We analyzed the data of twelve cases with head and neck tumors (4 tongue cancers, 4 hypopharyngeal cancers, and the rest are nasopharyngeal cancer). They received bilateral parallel opposed fields or initial treatment. The thickness of head and neck was estimated from CT scan, the reference point of the thickness of head was defined at field center, and the reference points of the thickness of were defined at cross-section of C3-C4 interface, 2 cm from anterior margin of neck (reference point A), 3 cm anterior margin (reference point B). During simulation, the area with significant deficit was delineated, and was analyzed on CT scan. If the line along the anterior border of vertebral body was defined as the base of a triangle, we can find the base angle θ of anterior neck. Following measurcment and analysis of angle θ of different sections on CT scan, several sets of compensator were made.\\nResults: If the given dose was normalized at the center of radiation field, the average percentage of overdose of anterior neck was as following: reference point A, 13.7% (10.0~166.6) for tongue cancer, 7.4% (5.8~9.9) for hypopharyngeal cancer, 13.6% (12.4~14.4) for nasopharyngeal cancer; reference point B, 11.7% (9.5~14.7), 5.4% (4.0~6.7), and 10.1% (7.4~13.1) respectively. The degree of angle θ at different cross-sections of anterior neck were all within the range of 35° to 55°. With the interval of 5 degree as a unit, the mean degree of angle θ is 45°for 9cases, 50°for 2 cases, and 40°for one case. After the application of compensator with simple slope(40°, 45°, and 50°), the overdose of anterior neck has been substantially improved.\\nConclusion: When bilateral parallel opposed fields are used for the initial treatment of head neck tumors, the dose nonuniformity of anterior portion of neck should be assessed. If significant overdose was noted and it is impossible to make tissue compensator case by case, the simple application model of tissue compensator for anterior neck can be considered.',\n",

The median prescribed tumor dose was 70 GY with a range of 60~130 GY and the daily fraction size was 1.8-2.0 Gy, 5 fractions per week. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method. Differences between survival curves were compared using the log rank test.\\nResults: The 5- and 10-year survivals are 53.0% and 30.9%, respectively. Patients receiving radical surgery before radiotherapy showed a better 5-year survival. The complete response rate is 30% and partial response rate is 22% in our study after radiotherapy. The overall local failure and distant metastasis rate are about 35% and 13%. No correlation could be made between the survival and histology, staging group, and sex in our study. The magnitude of improved survival by the aid of CT scanning is not significant in our study (p=0.2867). Late complications are not common, including xerostomia, trismus, headache, local tenderness and swelling, epistaxis, conjunctival congestion, and blindness.\\nConclusion: All of the patients in our study had the tumor involving more than one site. The maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were the most common primary tumor sites in our study (81.7% and 14.6%). Patients receiving radiotherapy alone had relative poor prognostic factors and the cure was not achieved by conventional radiotherapy alone in most patients. In view of the poor local control for advanced unresectable paranasal sinuses cancer and relative low morbidity with standard-dose irradiation, we have conducted cancer and relative low morbidity with standard-dose irradiation, we have conducted dose escalation using hyperfractionation regiment and CT based 3-D conformal treatment planning in recent years.

There should be a qualified radiation protection commissioner to supervise all procedures of dismantling the machine and the safety of transportation.\\nMaterials and Methods: After gaining the approval of the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) at the executive yuan, all procedures concerning radiation protection, works should be considered and in line with the steps according to ”Regulations about the Security of Transporting Radioactive Materials” and ”Rules of Ionizing Radiation Security” which are issued by AEC. Aiming at the workers who received radiation exposures during the dismantling gauge planned special exposures and extimating the doses.\\nResults: After conscientious and careful practices, planning and controlling of radiation protection obey the rule of ALARA (as low as reasonable achievable) whole dismantling and transportation of the cobalt-60 machine was smoothly accomplished.\\nConclusion: This paper describes the procedure about how to handle the retiring of a cobalt-60 machine and estimate personal dose fully and accurately.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: In this paper, the PTW N23333 ionization chamber was used to calibrate the in air exposure rate of IR-192 HDR brachytherapy source in a Gammamed 12I remote afterloading machine. The exposure rate of the source in finite cylinder plexiglass phantom that was equipped with the system was measured. The calibration factor of the plexiglass phantom for IR-192 source activity calibration is discussed and the clinical advantages of the phantom is summarized.\\nMaterials and Methods: The in air exposure rate of the source was measured with the PTW N2333 ionization chamber connected to the Capintec electrometer at SCD equal to 8 cm. Source activity was calculated from the measured exposure according to the suggested parameters of AAPM Report 41. The in phantom exposure rate were measured with and without water phantom to calculated the back-scatter-factor of the plexiglass phantom.\\nResults: The back-scatter-factor is equal to 1.081 and the factor Cgrad=1.158 should be considered to calibrate the scatter from the upper and button side of the phantom which was less due to the lack of scatter and dose gradient correction.\\nConclusion: Calibrations in plexiglass phantom of Ir-192 HDR brachy-therapy source allow more stability and reproducibility. The calibration factors of the plexiglass phantom needs to be considered in routine source calibration.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: Discussing the dose evaluation process for Hodgkin's disease radiotherapy and the clinical practice. \\nMaterials and Methods: Using the Clarkson's method to evaluate mantle and inverse Y fields dosimetry for a eighteen-year-old Hodgkin's disease patient in our hospital, and estimate the boost dose from treatment planning, otherwise, calculate the gap between two adjacent fields.\\nDiscussion: The main error of dose evaluation came from the non-flatteness of body, which up to 6%. Since lung was blocked, the inhomogeneity between lung and adjacent tissue in the mantle field caused on effect to dose evaluation. The rib's effect which within 1% is negligible.\\nConclusion: Clarkson's method is a useful way to evaluate the dose of irregular fields, but it is time wasting and laborious. Computerization or equivalent squares template may be applied to increase clinical practice.\",\n",
       " \"Radiation therapy played a classic role in the radical treatment of localized Hodgkin's disease. We described a Hodgkin's disease patient, stage ⅡA, who was found a left lung mass on a chest film 2 months after irradiation. The mass was near the left lower heart border and obliterated the left diaphragm silhouette. Because the location was quite different from the commonly recognized paramediastinal radiation pneumonitis following mantle-field irradiation, the lesion has been mistakenly interpreted as a recurrent tumor or tuberculoma. After reviewing and comparing the chest radiograph with the subdiaphragmatic port-film, a diagnosis of radiation pneumonitis due to spleen irradiation was suspected. Given only symptomatic treatment, the mass spontaneously resolved 3 months later. The unusual case highlighted the importance of knowledge of the radiationport arrangement on the correct interpretation of a follow-up chest radiograph in Hodgkin's disease patients receiving radiotherapy.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: To evaluate the change of whole salivary flow rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before and after radiotherapy, and to examine whether hyperfractionated regimen may induce less damage to the salivary glands than conventional technique. \\nMaterials and Methods: This study included 30 and 17 patients irradiated using conventional and hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Whole salivary flow rates were measured both at resting and stimulated status before, during, 1, 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. \\nResults: A large variation in unirradiated salivary flow rate was noted with the range for resting and stimulated rates of 0.01-0.83 ml/min and 0.08-2.83 ml/min, respectively. After 360-720 cGy, the resting and stimulated salivary flow rate had already decreased by 30-50%. The nadir was reached in many patients after 3600 cGy. Statistical analysis did not show significant difference between the hyperfractionated and conventional groups. However, after completing radiotherapy and up to 6 months' follow-up, a marginal difference favoring hyperfractionated group was noted both for resting and stimulated flow (p=0.039 & 0.04, respectively). In addition, female, high initial salivary flow rate, and older age might predict more salivary flow rate reduction after radiotherapy. \\nConclusions: Salivary glands were highly radiosensitive, and saliva excretion dropped by 30-50% after 360-720 cGy. The present study did not show a significant reduction of damage to the salivary glands using hyperfractionated radiotherapy.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: In patients with locally recurrent or advanced abdominal/pelvic malignancies, long-term disease control and survival are difficult to achieve with single modality therapy. This report presents the preliminary results of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in our hospital. \\nMaterials and Methods: In our hospital, TORT has been utilized either as part of the initial management in some previously untreated primary malignancies (e.g., pancreatic carcinoma, gastric carcinoma) or part of the salvage or adjuvant treatment in other malignancies (e.g., recurrent rectal or cervical cancer) since March 1996. Up to November 1997, 48 adult patients underwent this treatment modality with age ranging from 32.4 to 75.7 years old (median: 60.5). The malignancies treated by IORT consisted of 19 pancreatic cancers, 6 cholangiocarcinomas, 6 gastric cancers, 9 colorectal cancers, one case of recurrent jejunal leiomyosarcoma, and 7 gynecologic cancers. \\nResult: Twenty-eight of 48 patients (58%) were alive (including 7/19 pancreatic cancers, 4/6 cholangiocarcinoma, 3/6 gastric cancers, 8/9 colorectal cancers, 5/7 gynecologic cancers). Except for some patients with pelvic malignancies receiving pelvic exenteration, all of the other patients had either gross residual or unresectable disease. Seventy-four percent of the patients with pancreatic cancer suffering from epigastralgia or back pain before treatment had achieved good symptomatic relief after surgery and IORT. TORT-related complications due to high dose irradiation occurred in two patients (4%). \\nConclusion: The preliminary results suggested that IORT was a safe and feasible modality for abdominal pelvic malignancies at high risk for local recurrence. It was especially effective in relieving tumor pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Longer follow-up should be needed to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of this approach.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: This study was to analyze the treatment results of our patients with rectal adenocarcinoma receiving curative surgery ± radiotherapy and discuss the role of salvage treatment for recurrence. \\nMaterials and Methods: A total of 90 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who received radiotherapy from 1980 to 1995 were registered at Department of Radiation Oncology, Taichung Veteran General Hospital. The patients who were found to have extrapelvic extension at operation, palliative surgery at diagnosis, and incomplete data were excluded. Sixty patients were analyzable. All these 60 patients received potentially curative surgery at diagnosis. Adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy or chemotherapy was mainly decided by the surgeon. Recurrence of tumor was documented by physical examination, imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI, colonosoopy, CEA, or sonography. The salvage treatment of recurrent tumor included reoperation with curative or palliative intent, radiotherapy alone or with chemotherapy. Analysis of survival was calculated from the date of operation using Kaplan-Meier method. \\nResults: Of these 60 patients 2- and 5-year overall survival rate were 63% and 33%, respectively. Overall recurrence rate was 88%. The mean loco-regional recurrence time was 26 months vs. 21 months for distant metastasis. Only 5 patients with isoloated pelvic recurrence can be salvaged by reoperation with curative intent. The patients with recurrent cancer receiving palliative surgery survived at a median of 6 months. Seven patients with recurrent disease were salvaged with radiotherapy only. The patients with salvage surgery survived at a median of 16 months after diagnosis of recurrence vs. 8.5 months for patients with salvage radiotherapy only. Clinical variables such as age, gender, stage, tumor location, and tumor size had no statistically significant impact on survival. \\nConclusion: There was substantially high recurrence rate for patients with even potentially curative resection of primary rectal adenocarcinoma. A minority of patients with isolated local recurrence can be salvaged by aggressive reoperation with a relatively long survival.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To conduct a survey on the institutional manpower, patients, and treatment characteristics at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 1987-1996. Some of the survey items were compared with results of Patterns of Care Study (PCS) in the United States. \\nMethods and Materials: The database of 9785 radiotherapy (RT) patients registered in a personal computer-based cancer registry system between 1987 and 1996 was reviewed and analyzed. Major items of the survey included: new cases per annum (NCPA), patient referral, average patient load and its trends over time, disease patterns, treatment intent, treatment completion, fractionation patterns, and application of computer in the assistance of radiotherapy treatment planning. \\nResults: (1) The NCPA ranged from 458 to 1264, the mean being 1087. The number increased by year, and reached a plateau during the last four years. The crude rate of patient referral for RT was 30%. The referral rate in the two treatment periods, 1987-1991 and 1992-1996, increased mildly from 26% to 33%, respectively. (2) The average patient load (NCPA per personnel or machine) was as follows: radiation oncologist: 281 (range, 177-339); physicist: 350 (range, 280-466); technologist: 123 (range, 86-157); machine: 428 (range, 298-705). The patient load for personnel and machine declined overtime. (3) The five diseases most commonly treated were cancers of the lung (15.9%), cervix (14.5%), nasopharynx (13.1%, NPC), head/neck (12.2%, exclude NPC), recto-sigmoid (7.2%). Purely benign disorders accounted for about 1% of cases. (4) Pediatric patients of age ＜ 15 years accounted for 1.8% of cases. (5) Fifty-seven percent of patients were treated with curative-intent (definitive plus adjuvant). Twelve percent of patients were treated with salvage FIT for postsurgical recurrence. (6) The overall treatment completion rate was 76%. (7) Conventional fraction, 1.8-2 Gy/day, was used in 69% of patients. Twice-a-day (BID) scheme accounted for 1% of cases. (8) The application of computerized treatment planning increased by sixfold in the two treatment peroids, 1987-1992 and 1992-1996, respectively. There was an obvious trend toward a decreased use of two-dimensional planning and an increase of three-dimensional planning. \\nConclusion: Compared with the PCS survey, there was a similar trend toward a decline of average patient load for personnel and machine over time. The rate of cancer patients referral for radiotherapy was significantly lower than the PCS survey in the United States. Regarding the treatment, the BID scheme was rarely used throughout the period of the survey. The treatment completion rate and percentage of patients treated with curative intent appeared satisfactory and comparable with the result of PCS survey.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To study the killing effects of menadione alone or combined with ionizing radiation on human hepatoma Hep3B cell. \\nMaterials and Methods: log-phase Hep3B cells were treated with menadione, ionizing radiation or the combination of both agents. Three protocols for combined treatments: first, cells were pre-treated with 35 µM menadione for 3 hours then irradiated; second, cells were irradiated followed by the menadione treatment; third, cells were concurrently treated with both agents. \\nResults: The menadione inhibited the Hep3B tumor cells growth, the IC50 was around 60 μM. The intracellular reduced glutathione was significantly decreased after menadione treatment for 3 hours. After combined treatment most surviving fractions were less than 15%. \\nConclusions: Both 'pre-irradiation followed by menadione' and 'concurrent treatment' have synergistic effect. However, 'pre-treatment of menadione followed by irradiation' only has the addition effect. This finding may be useful for clinical application of menadione when combined with ionizing radiation to treat cancers.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: To examine the immunopotentiating ability of Lactobacteriaceae with Ganoderma lucidum in vitro and compare the anti-tumor ability of Lactobactcriaceac with that of BCG using a mouse model injected with sarcoma cells. \\nMaterials and Methods: The immunopotentiating ability was tested in vitro using the stimulation of interferon- gamma production by mouse spleen cells. The delayed type hypersensitivity shown by foot swelling scale was chosen as an index of adjuvant effect. Anti-tumor ability was examined by simultaneously injected bacteria cells with sarcoma cells on mouse left hind leg. \\nResults: The concentrations of interferon-gamma proliferation by various heat-killed Lactobateriaceae cells were higher than four tested Ganoderma lucidum products, but slightly lower than Con A. Simultaneously injected SRBC with heat-killed Lactobacteriaceae cells showed an adjuvant effect on foot swelling in mouse model. Mice immunized with heat-killed Lactobacteiraceae cells had higher foot swelling scale when challenged with SRBC three weeks later. Heat-killed Lactobateriaceae cells demonstrated a better inhibition of tumor growth than viable BCG. \\nConclusion: The immunopotentiating and anti-tumor abilities of Lactobacteriaceae are initially verified, further studies should be carried on.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the extent of influence of setup deviation by pelvic immobilization device. \\nMaterials and Methods: This prospective randomized study composed of two study groups that were with or without pelvic immobilization device. We included three kinds of malignant diseases that originated in pelvic cavity; these were 10 cases of cervical cancer, 4 cases of prostate cancer, and 2 cases of rectal cancer. Except from the two patients of rectal cancer, all of them were treated with four-field box technique and the principle of radiation technique was all the same in both groups. The portal films were taken from anterior-posterior and bilateral directions with the frequency of twice per week. There were 34 simulation films and 149 portal films to be evaluated. The setup error was recorded by comparison the iso-center shift between simulation and portal films of four individual axes, that were latero-lateral, caudo-cranial, anterior-posterior axis and degree of rotation. The statistic methods for evaluation the results were two-tall t-test and chi-square methods for mean value of setup deviation and ratio of iso-center shift exceeded 5-mm, respectively. \\nResults: The patterns of setup error were different between non-immobilization and immobilization groups. When evaluated by mean setup error, there were no significant differencer between the two groups of the laterolateral (p=0.44S) and caudo-cranial (p=0.092) axes, the degree of rotation was also no difference at all (p=0.337). In anterior-posterior axis evaluated by gantry 270 degree, the mean setup error of the immobilization group (0.21-mm, SD=l.llmm) was significant smaller than non-immobilization group (1.54-mm, SD=2.SSmm) (p=0.016). Evaluation by the ratio of iso-center shift exceeded 5-mm, the immobilized group showed significant reduction in the error of anterior-posterior axis (p=0.046), but this group had opposed behavior of the caudocranial axis (p=0.0l8). The latero-lateral (p=0.359) and rotational (p=0.803) axes did not show any significant difference between the two groups. \\nConclusion: With the immobilization device, there has significant improvement of the anterior-posterior axis, but the caudo-cranial axis has opposed effect when we evaluated by the ratio of setup error exceeded 5-mm. The iso-center shift in latero-lateral axis has no significant difference despite of the used of this immobilization device. So, we must pay more effort to avoid the inter-treatment variation of the caudo-cranial axis when we use this kind of pelvic immobilization device.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: A beam port of epithermal neutrons at Tsing Hua Open Pool Reactor (THOR) was recently built. This port was designed for basic research on boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The research team consisted of radiobiologists, pharmaceutical chemists, medical scientists, nuclear engineers, and health physicists. The dosimetry group took the responsibility for the assessment of tumor/normal tissue biological doses. Radiation dose and quality were assessed in this work, \\nMaterials and Methods: The basic principle of BNCT is to deliver (superscript 10)B-laheled drug to the patient. (superscript 10)B isotope will accumulate in tumor mostly. Following the irradiation of an epithermal (thermal) neutron beam, (superscript 10)B(n,α)^7Li nuclear reactions occur and short-range and high LET particles emit. These particles kill the tumor cells but unharm the normal tissues. We focus our study on equivalent doses, effective quality factors (Q) and effective radiation weighting factors (W(subscript R) ) by the dosimetric model. \\nResult: In low boron concentration, the relation between equivalent dose and boron concentration was nonlinear. At such concentration, when decreased, the radiation effects for tumor and normal tissues were approximately the same. The therapeutic effectiveness by BNCT was decreased. As boron concentration increased the relation became linear and the therapeutic effectiveness was better. \\nConclusion: A computer code was developed to calculate the dosimetric quantities from input of boron concentration, neutron flux and energy, irradiation geometry and time. Results were analyzed as a function of separate and combined input factors. Optimal irradiation conditions were recommended for future clinical application.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To understand the TLD response for low energy proton in order to establish the proton dose measurement technique at Bragg peak in the future. \\nMaterials and Methods: Under the best annealing condition treatment and making sure the surface characteristics and cooling process after vacuum annealing had no significant effects to thermoluminescent response, TLD samples were put into the ABS TLD holder in the vacuum chamber. Proton generated from a Cockroft-Walton accelerator in the energy range of 30-100 keV were appropriately collimated and made to pass through a 10 µg/cm^2 carbon foil. After Rutherford scattering, proton uniformly irradiated TLDs which were placed at the 20° behind and 20 cm away from the carbon foil. We used a channeltron behind TLD holder as the proton detector. After irradiation, readout of the TLD samples was done with a TLD reader and comparison of the glow curve under different proton energies was initiated. \\nResults: The result showed that the TLD-200, TLD-300 sensitivities increased while proton energy decreased (LET decreased), which was consistent with track structure theory. While TLD-300 glow curve analysis conformed to the deep trap competition model, it also showed that the glow peaks (P2, P3, P5) of TLD-300 depended on proton energy in the range of 30-100 key. \\nConclusion: TLD-200, TLD-300 have sufficient sensitivity to be proton detectors, but they are not a tissue equivalent material and need some calibration process. Furthermore, it still needs more sensitivity calibration factor measurements for different energies of proton to makes proton dose evaluation complete.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: When electron beams are used for radiotherapy, the treatment portals are often shaped to fit the treatment area. In some clinical application, a larger nominal gap is necessary. For these different applicator effects, we most determine empirically these effects for the applicator system employed. \\nMaterials and Methods: In this paper, a 10×10 cm^2 open cone, a 10 x 10 cone with 5 cm diameter circular cutout, and a 5 cm diameter open cane for 12 MeV, 80 MU electrons will be studied. Change the air gap between the collimator and the phantom surface from 0 cm to 10 cm. We measure parameters and compare these differences. \\nResults: When applicator is a 10×10 cm^2 open cone resulting in larger X-ray background, larger D(subscript max), G0 and flatness is better. If the applicator is a 10×10 cm^2 cone with 5 cm diameter circular cutout, the X-ray background is smaller. As the air gap between the collimator and the phantom surface increases the penumbra increases, X-ray background and scatters increase, too. We also find that the 10×10 cm^2 open cone for the effect of the air gap is larger. \\nConclusion: Electron beams with a 10×10 cm^2 open cone can be used to treat larger tumors. To treat smaller tumors, a 10 x 10 cm2 cone with 5 cm diameter circular cutout will be better. The flatness and effective treatment size of electron beams with a 10×10 cm^2. cone with 5 cm diameter circular cutout are better than with a 5 cm diameter open cone.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To study whether a xenogeneic cell line engineered to express the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) and/or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can be used as cellular vaccine to repress tumor growth.\\nMaterials and Methods: The HSVtk gene, murine GM-CSF gene, or both were stably transfected into the human cervix cancer cell line HeLa, thus creating three different cell lines designated as H-tk, H-gm, and H-tk/gm. The tumor model we tested was the KBALB sarcoma cells in syngenic BALB/c mice. For in vivo studies, equal number of KBALB cells and H-tk, H-gm, or H-tk/gm cells were premixed and injected into the right flanks of mice. The tumor growth was monitored after ganciclovir (GCV) administration.\\nResults: Two HSVtk-expressing clones (H-tk 2-3 and H-tk 12-2) were isolated. The established H-tk/gm or H-gm cell line was confirmed to express GM-CSF by supporting the growth of a GM-CSF-dependent cell line NSF6O. The right flank tumors in mice injected with premixed K-BALB and H-tk cells showed no definite growth retardation upon GCV administration. Further studies implied that the H-tk cells expressed HSVtk in the injection sites, but failed to confer bystander effect between homologous cells by in vitro studies. The right flanks of mice injected with premixed K-BALB and H-tk/gm or Hgm showed no detectable or much delayed tumor growth either with or without GCV administration; however, the left flank K-BALB tumor progressed with similar growth curve in each study group.\\nConclusion: Cur studies suggest that though HeLa cells can express HSVtk gene in vivo, they can not confer bystander killing effect to xenogeneic tumor (sarcoma) cells upon GCV administration. This might be because the HeLa cells are intrinsically resistant to metabolic cooperation with other cells. Local production of GM-CSF is able to suppress local tumor growth, but not potent enough to induce distant antitumor immunity. This inability might be related to insufficient duration or amount of GM-CSF action.',\n",

Our study is to analyse the treatment outcome of cervical cancer in the past five years at Shin Kong Memorial Hospital. In order to refine future treatment protocol, the possible risk factors of late rectal complications will also be analysed.\\nMaterials & Methods: From September 1992 to December 1994, 109 patients with uterine cervical cancer completed planned radiotherapy (RT) at Shin Kong Memorial Hospital. Treatment consisted of external beam RT followed by HDR (high dose rate) intracavitary brachytherapy. After external RT dose of 40~44 Gy to whole pelvis, bilateral parametrium of stage (IIb cases were further boosted to 54~58 Gy with central shielding. Intracavitary brachytherapy consisted of three to four insertions with intervals of one week. The prescribed dose of each insertion was 7.2 Ely to point A, while in some circumstances (old age or high cumulative rectal dose), point A dose had been modified to 5-6 Gy. One hundred and two cases (24 Iv-IIa, 48 IIb, 26 IIIa-b, 4 IVa) received follow-up and were enrolled for the study.\\nResults: After 30 to 54 months of follow-up (median 39 months), 65 cases was alive (one was noted to have distant metastasis), 37 cases died of disease (8 for local reurrence, 16 for distant metastasis, one for both), 3 cases died of complication, while 9 cases were dead due to intercurrent disease. The 3-year cause-specific survival and local control rates are 95%/95% for Ib-IIa, 84%/92% for IIb, 50%/78% for IIIa-b, 25%/50% for stage IV, respectively. A total of 86 cases who survived more than one year were further analysed to define the risk factors of late gastrointestinal complication. Twenty-six patients (30.2%) was noted to have late rectal sequale (RTOG gradeI 14, gradeI 8, gradeIII-IV 4), while four cases (4.6%) developed ileus. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a high risk of late rectal sequale in those who were stage IIb-IV cases, total rectal dose (external RT+total ICRU rectal dose)＞65 Gy, and overall treatment time＞70 days.\\nConclusion: Our current study show the treatment outcome of Figo IIIa-tub cases is not satisfactory. Because 18 patients (17.6%) were noted to have distant metastases, it might be recommended to select high risk patients to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. With our present tratment proctocol, there will be about 30% of cases to have different extent of radiation proctitis. We will continue to analyse possible risk factors of late rectal complications and promote the therapeutic gain of HDR brachytherapy based treatment planning.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: Synchronous brain metastases (SM) of lung cancer patients indicate advanced stage and limited survival. The treatment intent is to relieve the agonizing symptoms. We analyzed the results of radiotherapy for these patients to evaluate the effects of palliative treatment.\\nMaterials and Methods: From 1987 to 1994, 102 lung cancer patients with CT-documented synchronous SM were reviewed. All patients received cranial irradiation (median dose 30 Gy) and dexamethasone. Chemotherapy and neurosurgery were performed in 14 and 9 cases respectively. Thirty patients also underwent lung irradiation.\\nResults: The two leading neurological symptoms were motor weakness (67.6%) and headache (55.9%). The mean duration of cranial irradiation was 15.2 days. After treatment, overall neurological symptomatic response rate was 74.3%. Median survival was 4.2 months and 1-year survival rate was 14.7%. The multivariate survival analysis showed that good performance status, higher total cranial radiation dose, neurosurgery, and absence of urine/stool incontinence were favorable prognostic factors.\\nConclusions: Owing to short life expectancy and neurological morbidity of lung cancer patients with synchronous SM, a good palliative treatment to improve life quality is required in supportive care of these patients. Radiotherapy appears as an effective means of palliation with 74.3% neurological symptomatic response rate while the median duration of cranial irradiation is only 15 days. Lung irradiation has no significant effect on survival; instead, it should be used for palliation of symptoms.',\n",

There were 9 boys and 13 girls between 1.6 and 17.4 years of age at diagnosis. According to French- American-British (FAB) classification, seventeen patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 5 patients had acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). The radiation dose was 1800 cGy given in 10 to 15 fractions. Prognostic factors such as leukemia subtype, age, sex, hemogram, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphoadenopathy and radiotherapy fraction were analyzed by retrospective review of the medical records. All patients were followed up regularly. The median follow-up time for patients still alive were 4.8 years (range 2.7 to 7.16 years).\\nResults: The common acute reactions were vomiting and headache. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 50%. Overall median survival time was 6 years; ALL was 6.16 years and ANLL was 2 years. Only one patient (5%) suffered from CNS relapse 1 year after PCI. The major cause of death was sepsis (55%). Adenopathy was the significant prognostic factors in this study.\\nConclusion: Leukemia involvement of the CNS remains a major clinical problem despite the improved disease control provided by mordern treatment regimens. In this study, excellent CNS prophylactic result (95%) was achieved in our cases, and we recommend that PCI should be incorporated in the management of pediatric acute leukemia. Besides, the most significant prognostic factor was adenopathy.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To measure the doses of contralateral breast from mono-isocenter tangential fields. To investigate the shielding effect of lead sheet and rubber bolus and evaluate the availability on practical treatment.\\nMaterials and Methods: We develop mono-isocenter tangential technique. Two tangential fields was applied to treat patient's breast, chest wall, internal mammary chain and axillary lymph nodes. The supraclavicular lymph nodes were treated with a supraclavicular field. 11 stage III, IV post-mastectomy patients were enrolled in our study. TLDs were placed on their contralateral breast for dosage evaluation with the following condition: (1) without rubber bolus or lead sheet, (2) with lead sheet, (3) with rubber bolus. The prescribe dose was 180 cGy daily.\\nResults: We found that the to contralateral breast was 11±1.9 cGy daily, when there is no shielding. By adding 0.5cm, 1cm, 1.5cm and 2cm bolus on contralateral breast, the doses decreased to 4.6±0.5 cGy, 3.2±0.3 cGy, 3.0±0.2 cGy and 2.8±0.1 cGy, respectively. While 0.3cm and 0.5cm lead sheet were added, the doses decreased to 2.7±0.2 cGy and 2.6±0.2 cGy, respectively. Therefore, while the total dose reach 5040 cGy, the dose to contralateral breast was estimated as 332 cGy. Adding a 2cm bolus or 0.5cm lead sheet will effectively reduce the dose to 80 cGy and 73 cGy, respectively, which eliminate approximately 75% scatter radiation doses.\\nConclusion: Rubber bolus is usually used for increasing body surface dose during radiation therapy. This study indicated that rubber bolus can decrease the doses to contralateral breast when a tangential field technique is applied.

We report a case of an 80-year-old male patient with a nasal cavity tumor. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery was performed and the pathology revealed inverted papilloma and sarcomatoid carcinoma. This combination has not previously been reported. Radiotherapy was administrated because of advanced disease, inadequate surgical margins, and the unique pathological findings. A 3-field technique was used, with a total dose to 5940 cGy. No recurrence was noted. This suggests that radiotherapy may be a useful adjuvant therapy for improving local control of this disease.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To report the result of palliative intracavitary brachytherapy in recurrent esophageal cancer patient.\\nMaterials and Methods Since January 1996, there were two recurrent esophageal cancer patients with symptoms of severe dysphagia who received intracavitary brachytherapy as palliative treatment. The treatment were carried out by a microSelectron-HDR afterloading device with lridium-192 radiation source and a special catheter which was  designed for esophageal applications. One patient was treated by a treatment volume including the middle third of the esophagus, 9cm in length, the prescribed dose point was one cm in depth from the central axis of the source. The total treatment dose was 2000 cGy in 10 fractions within 2 weeks. The brachytherapy for another patient was arranged to cover the upper part of the esophageal tumor with 2cm in length and the prescribed dose point was one cm in depth. The total treatment dose was 2000 cGy in 4 fractions within 12 days.\\nResults The symptoms of the first patient had improved after the first 5 fractions of HDR treatments. He could eat liquid diet after this treatment but odynophagia occurred. Two months later, he expired due to tumor bleeding and cachexia. After 2 fractions of intracavitary brachytherapy, the second patient could swallow some saliva, and the NO tube could be inserted more deeply. He felt better due to less production of saliva after treatment. He expired due to pneumonia in two months. The purpose of improving quality of life could be reached via this kind of treatment without severe acute toxicity except for grade one esophagitis.\\nConclusion; Palliative intracavitary brachytherapy can be a successful treatment for relief of dysphagia for patients with recurrent esophageal cancer patients with previous external beam radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Altered fractionated radiotherapy can enhance the local control in many types of tumor when compared with conventional radiotherapy, especially for head and neck cancer. The purpose of this prospective phase II study is to evaluate the feasibility, response and toxicities of accelerated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).\\nMaterials and Methods: Through December 1992 to December 1995, 43 patients with pathologically documented NPC were entered. There were 32 male and 11 female with a median age of 51 years (range 28-78). The pathology of most patients (91%) belongs to WHO type II and III. According to 1988 AJCC staging system, 37 patients (86.1%) were stage IV, 5 (11.6%) stage III, and 1(2.3%) stage II. The accelerated radiotherapy consists of 1.5 Gy/fraction, two fractions per day, with at least a 6-hour interval. The total dose is usually 72 Gy/48 fractions in 5 weeks.\\nResults: The major toxicities were mucositis and skin reaction. Grade 3/4 mucositis occurred in 24 patients (55.8%) and grade 3/4 skin reaction in 26 patients (60.5%). Eleven patients asked to change to conventional radiotherapy (1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction, one fraction per day) during the later part of radiotherapy, and 2 patients had interruption for 2 and 4 weeks. Although the original accelerated schedule in 13 patients were modified, all patients completed the treatment with average dose 72 Gy/47 fractions/38 days (range 67.5-79 Gy). After a median follow-up time of 41 months (range 24-60), the nasopharynx disease-free, neck disease-free, and distant metastasis disease-free survivals are 86.6%, 97.3%, and 71.2% respectively. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival are 54.1% and 65.7%. Most patients failed due to distant metastases.\\nConclusion: Our data indicate that accelerated radiotherapy for advance NPC is both feasible and effective, with acceptable toxicities. Post-radiation adjuvant chemotherapy to eradicate subclinical micrometastasis should be further studied.\\n［Therapeut Radiol Oncol 1997; 4:243-249］',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The survival of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patient improved after the advance in the diagnostic technology and in megavoltage facility of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy has become the standard local treatment for NPC, and failure in completion of the treatment will almost lose the chance for cure. There are few articles to explore and analyze the reasons why NPC patients interrupted or even refused the radiotherapy treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate the problem.\\nMaterial and Methods: There are 2,860 NPC cases registered in Radiation Oncology Department of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1979 to 1994. Two hundred and fifty-nine patients did not complete their treatment after registration. The survey from hospital records, telephone or mail contacts were used to analyze the reasons why these patients escaped from the treatment of local irradiation.\\nResults: One hundred and fifteen (44.4%) in these 259 patients cannot tolerate the acute reactions of the treatment or fear for the thought of the expected long-term sequels. Fifty-two patients (20.1%) had poor general condition, or psychologically ignored the disease. Forty-eight patients tried alternative treatments instead of the radiotherapy and seventeen suffered from economic problem. The last 14 patients either lacked the support from family or converted to have chemotherapy only by the referring physician.\\nConclusion: Adverse effect of radiation therapy in NPC is one of the important reasons to causing the cessation of the treatment. Alternative treatments are another motivation causing interruption of local treatment. Fail to have faith on the curable by radiotherapy and fear for the complications remained the main causes of interruption. It is important to encourage and help the NPC patients and their family to go through the local treatment.\\n[Therapeut Radiol Oncol 1997; 4:251-257]',\n",

The vial was then placed in the radiation beam at 1m against the target and irradiated to 40 Gy for 10MV to 18MV x-ray under the field size of 40cm×40cm. Samples of P205 were exposed to a mixed photon-neutron field with the reactions of ^31P(n,y)^32P and ^31P(n,p)^31Si. The irradiated samples were then dissolved in distilled water and the activation products were counted using the liquid scintillation counting techique with a counting efficiency approaching 100%. The decay characteristics of the sample was then analyzed to determine the fast and thermal neutron absorbed dose.\\nResults：Measurements for neutron contribution related to field size showed that the larger field size for irradiation, the more neutron contamination was generated. The total neutron fluence rate generated by five accelerators were in the range from 10^5 to 10^6ncm^-2 s^-1 for 10MV to 18MV x-ray machines with photon dose of 40Gy and field size 40cmX40cm.\\nConclusion：The total neutron absorbed dose was about 0.002% to 0.071% compared with treatment x-ray dose to the patient. It meets the criteria as set by the Atomic Energy Council. The requirement is that the neutron dose due to neutron contamination produced by a linear accelerator with voltage above 7MV should be less than 0.1% of radio-therapeutical dose to the patient.\\nfTherapeut Radiol Oncol 1997; 4: 265-270]',\n",

The information is mostly derived from site visits to several modern facilities in the United States and Japan.\\nDescription: The use of accelerating proton beams to effectively control solid tumors and arteriovenous malformations is one of the major breakthroughs that combine physics, biology and engineering for medicine in the twentieth century. In the past, the clinical outcomes of proton therapy by use of proton beams at physics laboratories have already been recognized by the medical community. More recent advances including the building of accelerator facility within a hospital and the development of isocentric beam delivery gantry permit the 3D physical dose distribution to reach its ever optimum status.\\nConclusions: The accelerator of a proton therapy facility can be selected from a linear accelerator, a cyclotron, or a synchrotron. The latter two kinds of accelerators are the current choices for hospital use and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In addition to an accelerator, beam extraction and transport system, beam delivery system, and patient positioning system are all integral parts of the facility.

Multiple channel analyzer was used for analysis of the radioactivity and the purity of the Ho-166-AcAc. Lipiodol was used as a carrier of Ho-166-AcAc. The stability of Ho-166-AcAc-lipiodol in serum was tested. The interaction of Ho-l65-AcAc lipiodol with human hepatoma cells (HepG2 cells) was investigated.\\nResult: In this study, the prepared Ho-l65-AcAc samples were irradiated in the nuclear reactor for up to 10 hr and yielded 16-l8mCi/SOmg of specific activity. In addition, in vitro analysis of the stability of Ho-166-AcAc-lipiodol in plasma revealed a 98% retention of Ho-166 in the Ho-l66-AcAc-lipiodol after 120 hr. In vitro treatment of HepG2 cells for 24 hr with Ho-165-AcAc-lipiodol resulted in a retention of 1.3µg of Ho-165-AcAc in 106 cells.

After the completion of treatment, 79 lesions showed incomplete regression; among them, 74 were squamous cell carcinoma, 4 were adenocarcinoma, and 1 was adenosquamous carcinoma. There were one stage ⅡA, 21 ⅡB, 3 ⅢA, 41 ⅢB, and 13 IVA. Incomplete regression of tumor was defined as having palpable or visible disease noted through out the treatment course and at the time of follow-up four weeks after the completion of treatment. Thirty patients received additional radiotherapy (ART), and 49 received no further therapy (NRT). ART was delivered by external beam, brachytherapy or electron cone. Dose ranged from 5 Gy to 40 Gy, (median 18 Gy). Minimal follow-up was one year.\\nResults: We observed similar local failures in ART and NRT groups (93% and 94%, respectively). The incidence of distant metastasis were 20% and 33% respectively for ART and NAT (p=0.24l). Overall survival at 2 years was 2% for NRT, and 17% for patients received ART (p=0.354). There were two grade Ⅲ and one grade IV complications in patients received ART, but their death was due to cancer, not to complication. ART did delay the progression of residual tumor with a p-value of 0.007, yet it had no beneficial gain in terms of survival, local and distal control.\\nConclusions: For incomplete-regressed cervical cancer after standard radiotherapy, ART cannot improve their outcome of survivals and tumor control but may delay the residual tumor's progression. Therefore the ultimal ways of ART to treat incomplete-regressed cervical cancer deserve further investigation.\",\n",

Chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU were given concurrently during the first and fifth weeks of radiotherapy.\\nResults: The major toxicities were mucositis, leucopenia, weight loss, and skin reaction. The 2nd cycle concurrent chemotherapy should be delayed for one week in 5 patinets. Two patients refused the 2nd cycle chemotherapy and another 2 patients received incomplete dose of 2nd cycle chemotherapy. Seven patients interrupted radiotherapy for more than one week doe to toxicities. One patient refused further radiotherapy after 55.5 Gy. Complete response was noted in 77 cases (96%) and partial response 4%, with an overall response rate of 100%. After a median follow-up time of 4 years (39-66 months), the nasopharynx disease-free, neck disease- free, and distant metastasis disease-free survivals are 87.5%, 9 1.8%, and 76.2% irrespectively. The 4-year over-alt survival and disease-free survival are 71.9% and 66.3%. Patients who failed were due to distant metastases.\\nConclusion: Our data indicated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced NPC is both feasible and effective, with acceptable toxicities. Post-radiation adjuvant chemotherapy to eradicate subclinical micrometastasis should be further studied.',\n",
       " '-Purpose: To assess the relationship between the pre-RJT EBV VCA titers and the characteristics of the patients with NPC and to analyze the prognostic value of the titers\\nMaterials and Methods: From April 1991 to September 1995, 101 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who received the examination of EBV VGA titers before radiotherapy were reviewed. We analyzed the correlation between titers and clinical characteristics, including genders, age, WHO histologic types and stages. We also tried to find the role of these titers in predicting prognosis.\\nResults: We found that the geometric mean titers of EBV VCA-IgA and IgG of these 101 patients were 102 and 1136 and the seropositive rates were 87% and 91.7%, respectively. The GMTs of IgA and IgG trended to be increased in advanced stages, but no significant difference in statistics. There is no significant difference of GMT5 in other clinical features, except IgA titer in sex. The seropositive rates were higher in elders, higher T stage and advanced stage. The role in predicting prognosis was not found.\\nConclusions: The pre-treatment EBV VGA GMTs increased in advanced stages, but the difference was not significant and they were not proper factors in predicting prognosis.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the treatment results and analyze the prognostic factors of postoperative radiotherapy for malignant parotid gland tumors.\\nMaterials and Methods: From January 1984 to December 1993, 42 patients with malignant parotid gland tumors received a complete course of radiotherapy at Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Twenty-eight of the 42 patients were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. There were 12 males and 16 females, between 15 and 78 years old (median: 46). The numbers of the patients in stage I to IV were 8, 6, 3, and 11, respectively. The types of cancer included mucoepidermoid carcinoma,8; adenocarcinoma,6; epidermoid caroinoma,3; adenoid cystic carcinoma,3; malignant mixed tumor,2; adenosquamous cell caroinoma,2; undifferentiated caroinoma,2; acinic cell carcinoma,1; and lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, 1. Most patients were treated with Go-60 using unilateral wedge pair fields and an electron beam local boost. The dose of radiotherapy was 57 to 72 Gy (median: 60 Gy).\\nResults: The patients were followed up till January 1997. The 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates were 78% and 65%, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was 89%. Three patients developed local recurrences at 3-12 months, 6 patients developed distant metastases at 3-69 months, and 2 had combined local recurrences and distant metastases. Most failure occurred in the first year after surgery. Five-year survival rates for stage Ito IV were 100%, 83%, 100%, and 55%, respectively. Lymph node involvement, stage, and histology were the significant prognostic factors (P＜0.05).\\nConclusions: Postoperative radiotherapy was effective in eradicating microscopic residual tumors and yielded a good local control rate. Lymph node involvement, stage, and histology were the significant prognostic factors. Lymph node involvement, stage IV tumors, and adenocarcinoma indicated a relatively poor prognosis.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To investigate the late endocrine dysfunction in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) following radiotherapy (RT).\\nMaterials & Methods: The endocrine function in 5 NPC patients (3 male and 2 female) treated with RT alone was analyzed in this study. Estimated doses to the hypothalamus, pituitary, and thyroid were 49.4-66.6 Gy, 50.9-70.2 Gy and 46.8 Gy, respectively. Growth hormone (GH), cortisol response to insulin tolerance test (In), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to TRH and gonadotropin response to LHRH were measured before, at 1.5 years and at 10 years after RT. The basal levels of prolactin, estradiol or testosterone, total triiodothyronine, and thyroxine were also measured at these time points.\\nResults: The pre-treatment endocrine function was normal in all patients. All of them developed GH deficiency and 2 patients with clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism had increased basal level of TSH at 10 years after RT. TSH responses to TRH were increased in 3 patients and delayed in 1 patient. One female patient developed amenorrhea and had decreased cortisol response to ITT. No hyperprolactinemia was observed in these patients.\\nConclusion: Endocrine dysfunction is a common complication in NPC patients following RT. The hypothalamic-pituitary region and thyroid gland should be shielded as much as possible if the possibility of cure is not compromised. Regular endocrine assessment and replacement of deficient hormone might be indicated in NPC patients following RT.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: irradiation to inguinal lymph node had a very important role to treat advanced stage perineal tumor for it had high incideoce of inguinal lymph node metastasis. It needs great caution to irradiate the ingoinal area. To irradiate with inadequate depth will cause poor control rate but too deep will lead risk of femoral head or neck fracture. We evaluate the depth of inguinal lymph nodes and propose the possible better irradiation method.\\nMaterial and Methods: We reviewed the CT films of sixty-five gynecological cancer patients who received radiotherapy to find the possible depth of inguinal nodes - the depth of four femoral vessels. We also calculated the irradiation dose distribotion by using different energy of photon beam, electron beam and various combination of photon and electron beams.\\nResults: The most superficial depth of inguinal lymph node ranged from 1 cm to 6.5 cm; the median was 3.75 and the mean was 2.49 cm. The most deep depth of inguinal lymph node ranged from 2.5 to 8.8 cm; the median was 5.65 cm and the mean was 4.46 cm. Using the photon beam to treat the inguinal will cause too much radiation dose to femoral head area. High energy electron was a good choice to treat the lesion with 3 cm depth without too much hot spot. To treat the depth of 5 cm, using the combination of 6 MV photon beam and high energy electron beam can get much homogenous dose distribution but also can reduce more than 20 % of dose to the femoral head area.\\nConclusion: It needs individual treatment plan according to the different depth to irradiate the inguinal lymph node area. To treat with appropriate depth with proper radiation modality not only can get good control but also to reduce the complication as much as possible.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Leipzig applicators are one kind of accessories of Nucletron (superscript 192)1r High-Dose Rate remote afterloading system. According to the orientation of the source axis in the applicator, it can be divided into two kinds: horizontal and vertical ones. There are three kinds of diameter for each type of applicator: 1, 2 and 3 cm. Five characteristics of the applicator will be measured for clinical application. They are geometric structure, relative output, percent depth dose, isodose curve distributions and real sagittal plane radiation leakage test.\\nMaterials and Methods: High accuracy calipers was used to measure the geometric structure of the applicator The relative outputs were measured with N.E. 0.03 cc. parallel-plate ionization chamber connected to Ionex Dosemaster 2590 in RMI solid phantom with 3 mm build-up layer The outputs were normalized to the dose in full phantom that was measured at the same source-to-chamber distance. The percentage depth dose and isodose curve distributions were measured with Scanditronix RFA300 water phantom connected to p-type electron beam semiconductor chamber The measurement was performed in water along the side Mylar window. The real sagittal plane radiation leakage of the applicator was measured with Kodak V film that was cut according to the shape of the applicator.\\nResults: The relative outputs of the horizontal type were increased 10%, while the vertical ones were decreased 9%. The effective source-to-surface distance of the horizontal type is equal to 1.93 cm and 1.74 cm for the vertical ones. The isodose curves are attenuated in the central axis of vertical type applicators due to the attenuation from catheter and source tip. The hot spots of the horizontal type applicators are located at the top of the applicator and at the sides for the vertical ones. The leakage is 30% for the horizontal types and 20% for the vertical types.\\nConclusion: Leipzig applicators can be used to treat some small volume cancer such as skin cancer, oral cancer and for other dose boost treatment. The dose can be estimated with BSSD to approximately 20% depth accurately. The hot spots of the applicators allow the user to avoid unnecessary exposure.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To study how the ferrous sulphate agarose gel reports the dose response and distribution to the mediums. The potential applications to clinical radiation therapy are also introduced.\\nMaterial and Method: Ferrous sulphate agarose gel containing ferrous ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, sulfuric acid and triple distilled water was employed to measure dose distribution in the mediums. The change for T1 of the spin-lattice relaxation rates of ferric ions with an MRI scanner was studied as a function of absorbed dose given to the gels. Breast-mimic gel phantom and inhomogeneous layer phantom were constructed to compare the 3D dose distributions in the gel phantoms with treatment planning dose distributions in these phantoms.\\nResult: The dose response of the gel is linear up to 30 Gy. The degree of homogeneity of the magnetic field, chemical diffusion and degradation of the gel are the major factors affecting the signal to noise ratio of the gel imaging.\\nConclusion: The gel may he applicable to 3D dose verification in the areas of bone and air interface, breast and chest wall. However, the signal strength and resolution of the gel images are still not clinically satisfactory. Further studies to improve the above insufficiencies are needed.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To test the performance of interstitial microwave antenna array hyperthermia system using a phantom model with or without flow effect\\nMaterial and Method: The heating device was a custom-made interstitial microwave antenna array hyperthermia system. Six 2450-MHz antennas which were implanted on the corners of a hexagon with intercather spacing of 15 mm were used in this system. A phantom with flow was designed, namely, one silicone tube inserted into a homogenons muscle phantom. The temperature data from four fibrooptic thermometers were fed to the personal computer which could record and analyze the data, also could control the output power of microwave source. To test the system performance, we devided the study into two stages. In the first stage, the thermal distribution in a phantom without flow was conducted. In the second stage, the experiments in a phantom with different flow rates (25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 ml/min) were designed. The flow rates of water through silicone tubes were controlled by a microtube pump.\\nResult: Using the automatic temperature and power control in this interstitial microwave antenna array hyperthermia system, the temperature distribution in phantom can be maintained uniformly in the range of 43-45 DC. The first-stage study showed that there was a tendency that the temperature was concentrated around the antennas. For the flow effect on thermal distribution, the results demonstrated that the faster flow rate would take more energy away in the transient period. However, the rate of energy loss caused by flowing water became constant when the flow rate was faster than l00ml/min.\\nConclusions: An interstitial microwave antenna array hyperthermia system for deep-seated heating was developed. The superior ability of this system in maintaining uniform temperature distribution around the heating area was also clearly demonstrated.',\n",

All these patients had received definitive radiotherapy to a median dose of 7200 cGy (range from 6800 to 7670 cGy). The failure patterns according to different T and N stages were evaluated. The possible prognostic factors were analysed by univariate analysis first, then those have significant p values were further eveluated by multivariate analysis.\\nResults: The survival rate, local failure free survival and disease-free survival at 5 years were 43.7%, 44.6% and 40.3%, respectively. The factors including T stage, characteristics of T4 invasion, total treatment time, lymph node response rate, T and N grouping, sex and platelet counts all showed statistically significance by univariate analysis. The multivariate analysis revealed both the characteristics of T4 invasion and T/N grouping are significant to the overall survival and local failure free survival, respectively.\\nConclusion: This study disclosed that the patients with Stage IV nasopharyngeal cancer have different prognosis according to different factors. In the future, we might design treatment policies according to different prognostic factors in an attempt to improve the treatment results.',\n",

       " 'Aims: To evaluation prognostic factors and treatment outcome for early stage endometrial cancer patients treated with surgery or combined surgery and radiation therapy (RT)\\nMaterial and Methods: We desinged a retrospective study for 143 patients with StageI/II endometrial cancer treated at Mackay Memorial Hospital between 1984 and 1996. Patients were restaged according to the 1988 EGO staging system. Patients with papillary serous, and clear cell histologies were excluded. Patients were considered as high risk group if they had one or more of the following factors: grade 3 tumor differentiation, depth of myometrial invasion＞1/2, pathologic cervical involvement, or adenosquamous histology. Of these 135 patients, 99 patients was treated with surgery alone (Group A) and the other 36 patients were treated with combined surgery and RT (Group B). Eight (8%) patients in group A and thirty (82%) patients in group B were defined high risk group. The main treatment modality consisted of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and/or postoperative external pelvic RT with/without intracavitary brachytherapy. The total dose of external pelvic irradiation is 4000-5400 cGy (median: 5013 cGy). Intracavity brachytherapy was given with 500 cGy per fraction prescribed to a depth of 0.5 cm under mucosal surface and the total dose was 1000-3000 cOy (median: 2933 cGy).\\nResults: Follow- up duration ranged from 6 to 147 months (median: 62 months). The 5-year overall survival rate in group A and group 13 were 96.9% and 89.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified the following significant prognostic factors: age, menopausal status and myometrial invasion. Multivariate analysis revealed myometrial invasion more than half of the thickness to be the only factor significant for reduce overall survival. Two of the 99 patients of group A had tumor relapse. The local control rate is 98%. Four of the 36 patients of group 13 had tumor relapse. The local control rate is 88%. Conclusion: Our retrospective study revealed good outcome associated with selective treatment combing surgery and RT for high risk patients. We also confirmed some important prognostic factors associated with survival. Base on the results of our study, further prospective study for the role of adjuvant radiation therapy for early stage endometrial cancer patient can be designed.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the therapeutic results of oral tongue cancer patients treated with curative intent at the National Taiwan University Hospital.\\nMaterials and Methods: From 1977 to 1994, 161 oral tongue cancer patients were treated by different modalities, including surgery alone (85 patients), radiotherapy alone (40 patients) and surgery followed by radiotherapy (36 patients). Patients were grouped according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Among these 161 patients, 33 (20%) were categorized as stage I; 53 (33%) stage II; 37 (23%) stage III and 38 (24%) stage IV. All of them were squamous cell carcinoma with a male to female ratio of approximately 4:1. The treatment results of primary control, neck node control, outcomes and complications were analyzed.\\nResults: More than four fifths of the lesions were located on the lateral border of the tongue and less than 5% were either on the dorsum or undersurface. Primary control rates of Ti and T2 diseases in the OP alone group were 90% and 86%, respectively. The T3 patients of OP+REF group had better primary control rate as 67%. Primary control of T4 disease was very poor hi our three treatment groups. Even for the early disease, patients receiving surgical resection of primary tumor without further neck treatment have a higher risk (28%) of neck failure. Five-year survival rates of stage Ⅲ patients were: R/T alone, 17%; OP alone, 24%; OP+R/T, 61%. Eighty-four percent and 72% recurrence in T3/T4 and T1/T2, respectively, occurred within one year after treatment. Overall, 86% recurrence occurred within the first 2 years. Sixteen patients (10%) showed evidence of distant metastasis; most commonly presented in the lung (75%). The risk of osteonecrosis was similar between OP+R/T group (6%) and R/T alone group (3%).\\nConclusion: In our study, surgery can control primary tumors effectively in Ti and T2 lesions. Advanced (T3 and T4) disease is unlikely to be cured by radiation therapy or surgery alone and therefore is best managed by a planned combination of surgery and radiation therapy. For stageⅢ group, five-year survival rate was significantly improved (p＜O.O5) for patients who were treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. When the primary lesion is treated by simple excision, neck failure is not uncommon and adjuvant radiotherapy to the neck lymphatics may decrease its occurrence. There was 14% of recurrence occurred beyond the first 2 years which indicated that a long period of follow-up was important for tongue cancer patients.',\n",

The 5-year survival rate (SR) and 5-year freedom from relapse rate (FFR) in different stages were calculated and classified by different treatment modalities.\\nResult: The overall 5-year survival rate (SR) and 5-year freedom from relapse rate (FFR) were summarized for stage I+Ⅱ, Ⅲ and IV diseases. In stage I+Ⅱ diseases, the SR of CIT, RIT and CRT groups were 50%, 60% and 89%; the FFR were 33%, 100% and 67% respectively. In stage Ⅲdisease, the SR of C/T and CRT groups were 72% and 90%; the FFR were 59% and 90% respectively. In stage IV disease, the SR of C/T and CRT groups were 45% and 38%; the FFR both were 38%. No statistical significance of SR was noted between CT, R/T and CRT groups in different stages. However, the FFR between C/T and R/T groups in the early stage showed statistical significance (p＜O.OS). Patients with histologic subtype of lymphocyte depletion had the worst prognosis than the other 3 histologic subtypes. C/T and CRT groups bad some complications while no complication was seen in the HIT group within the 5-year follow-up.\\nConclusion: In our study, Hodgkin's disease was potentially curable by using either C/T, R/T, or CRT. For stage Ⅲand IV diseases, no statistical significance was noted by C/T or CRT groups. However, for early stage disease, R/T is a better treatment of choice because R/T group had better FFR and no late complication.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: To estimate normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for nonuniform irradiation.\\nMaterials and Methods: Before calculation of NTCP, dose volume histograms are calculated for the organs of interest and tolerance doses for uniform whole and partial organ irradiation are obtained from published data. The calculation of dose volume histograms is straightforward if there are an adequate number of CT scans and dose distributions for organs of interest. The effective volume method transforms the histogram into a uniform one of height (effective volume) and dose (D(subscript max))equal to the maximum dose in the histogram. NTCP can be obtained using Lyman's model and table of the normal distribution.\\nResults: Dose volume histograms for various organs are obtained by calculation with Render-Plan treatment planning system. Effective volumes for these organs are obtained by calculation with Kutcher's effective volume method. Calculation using Lyman's model and table of the normal distribution, we obtained the NTCP values for these organs.\\nConclusion During radiotherapy normal tissues are irradiated along with the tumor. Radiation oncologists try to minimize the dose to normal tissues while delivering a high dose to the tumor. Often this is difficult and complications arise due to irradiation of normal tissues. Estimation of NTCP is important for evaluation of 3-dimensional treatment plans. It is preferable to use NTCP as an additional tool for plan evaluation, in conjunction with a review of graphical dose distributions and dose volume histograms.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: The transmission factors of each dynamic and fixed wedge were measured for Varian CL-2100C/D Sn: 481 linear accelerator. The factors were used to set-up the clinical treatment data tables for clinical dosimetry for dynamic wedges utilization. The data will be used to set-up the computer treatment planning database also.\\nMaterials and Methods: The N.E.0.6cc Farmer type chamber (Type: 2571) connected to lonex Dosemaster 2590 was installed on the chamber frame of Scanditronix RFA-300 water phantom with water prove protector. The axis of the chamber is perpendicular to the transverse plane of the wedge. Output factors in water were measured on the central axis of each field at 5-cm depth for 6 MV and 10-cm depth for 15 MV X-rays. The phantom was positioned with the water surface at 100 cm SSD. Measurements were performed for field sizes ranging from 4.0-20.0 cm and for equivalent square field to 25 cm. The measurements were performed for open, for fixed and dynamic wedge angles. The transmission factor of each field size was calculated from the output with/without wedge.\\nResults: The transmission factors of each fixed wedges were increased as field size increase. The increment is around 3%. The factors of the dynamic wedge were larger than the fix ones, but the factors were decreased irregularly when field size increase. The maximum decrement is 35%. Conclusion Transmission factor is an important parameter in clinical applications of wedge filters. The variation of the factors of dynamic wedges verse field size is not the same as fixed ones and more complex. Due to the variation of the factors, one should take more attention in the application and the data input of the planning system.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the therapeutic results of stage Ⅲ and IV advanced endometrial carcinoma treated at Mackay Memorial Hospital over the past ten years. To address the future direction in the management of this disease.\\nMaterials and methods: From July 1985 to June 1996, 174 patients with pathologically proven endometrial cancer were registered. All patients were staged according to the 1988 FIGO staging system. There were 25 cases with stage Ⅲ disease and 4 patients with stage IV disease. The median age was 57 years with a range of 40-79 years. Abnormal vaginal bloody discharge (21/29) was the most common symptom. Twenty-eight patients received a surgical approach initially. Seventeen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy to the whole pelvis with doses ranging from 5040 cGy to 5940 cGy and vaginal cuff irradiation with doses ranging from 2000 cGy to 3000 cGy, respectively. The follow-up period ranged from 2.5 months to 161.3 months. The acturial five-year cumulative survival rate was evaluated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and significance was calculated according to the Gehans General Wilcoxan test.\\nResults: Restaging showed 14 cases with stage ⅢA disease, 11 with stage ⅢC, 1 with stage IVA and 3 with stage IVB. The overall 5-year survival for all patients was 48.3%, and for stage Ⅲ patients was 52%. There were four patients with stage IV disease, three of them died during the follow-up. In addition, the overall 5- year survival rate was statistically higher in grade 1 and 2 than in grade 3 in superficial myometrial invasion and in the radiation group. Older aged patients did have a lower 5-year survival rate but it was not statistically significant.\\nConclusion: In patients with solitary extrauterine involvement, whole pelvis irradiation results in better survival. Gross adaexic involvement, para-aortic lymph node metastases and poordifferentiation or clear cell or papillary serous carcinoma have a more aggressive character, and so pelvic irradiation only as adjuvant therapy is inadequate. Therefore further aggressive therapy including extended-field irradiation, whole abdominal irradiation, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy should be considered.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: To evaluate the major salivary gland functions by sialoscintigraphy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated by radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: This analysis includes 28 nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients and 31 sialoscintigraphies. The sialoscintigraphies were grouped as pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT), low dose (＜1050 cGy), and high dose (＞1050 cGy) according to the radiation dose given to the patients when the scanning was performed. Apart from 3 patients who received 2scannings, the other 26 patients received only one test. Another 8 normal adult sialoscintigraphics were included as controls. Patients, noa-irradiated or irradiated with high or low doses, were given 10mCi(superscript 99m) Tc-pertechnetate and scanned immediately. Twenty minutes later 200 ml of lemon juice was given by month and the patient was scanned again for another 20 minutes. Time-activity curves and the cumulative gland (superscript 99m)Tc-pertechnetate uptake of each gland were plotted and calculated. The stimulated secretion is defined as: stimnlated secretion (SS)=[1-(min/max)]×100%. The downward slope was also obtained from the post-stimnlation curve of the time-activity curve to describe the secretory function.\\nResults: A strong positive excretion response after lemon juice stimulation of both parotid and submandibular glands was noted in non-irradiated patients. After irradiation of 1050 cGy or less, a significant impairment in secretion of all major salivary glands was noted. The trapping of (superscript 99m)Tc-pertechnetate was not affected as compared with the normal controls and pre-RT scannings. After a larger dose of radiations, no curves displayed excretory response after stimulation. In terms of qualitative measurement, the 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake is not different among the four groups of patients in either parotid or submandibular glands except in the group after high dose radiations. The down slopes and stimulated secretion are statistically different between the non-irradiated and the irradiated groups.\\nConclusion: The salivary gland secretion was totally or partially disturbed in all patients after high dose radiation . Cumulative uptake of (superscript 99m)Tc-pertechnetate after high dose is statistically higher than pre-RT patients. Stimulated secretion was markedly retarded after high dose radiation. The data imply that the mechanism of dry mouth after high dose irradiation was mainly excretory dysfunction rather than uptake disturbance of metabolic substances. This observation is valuable in the understanding of the underlying mechanism of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction, and may contribute to the future resolution of this difficult side effect.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: To describe the treatment facility and the proton treatment planning algorithm at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) for patient dose calculation.\\nMaterials and Methods: A 45-200 MeV proton beam line is available at IUCF for cancer patient treatments. The treatment beam line consists of a beam spreading system, range modulator and beam and dose monitoring diagnostics. Treatment planning is similar to conventional 3-D photon and electron radiotherapy. The dose calculation algorithm used is based on a ray-tracing method which assumes that protons penetrate dense media following straight paths. The proton multiple scattering effects are implicitly included in the algorithm by incorporating measured lateral beam data. Measured central axis depth dose data is also incorporated into the algorithm to model the energy loss process along defined proton ray paths. The well-known relationship between CT number and electron density (i.e. stopping power) of tissues was measured for our CT scanner and the data were then used to connect the input depth dose for tissue heterogeneities along proton ray paths. \\nResults and Discussion: A linear relationship between CT number and electron density over the range of interest was defined by direct measurements. The advantage of the chosen ray-tracing method lies in its short calculation time while maintaining a clinically acceptable point dose accuracy.

       " 'Introduction: This is to introduce a special brachytherapy application in radiotherapy intraoperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: Using an operation room possessing radiation-protection walls, monitors and computer-controlled anesthesia instruments, combined with remote-controlled high-dose-rate after-loading brachytherapy modality and a special designed super-flab or super-mould applicator, let radiation dose distribute very evenly on any surface of body inner cavity, especially on the arch surface, such as the cavity of pelvis or retroperitoneum. Since this is a radiotherapy during surgery, the possible radiation-damaged organs, such as intestine, kidney and liver can be blocked as much as possible. Hence, the effective radiotherapy dose can be reduced and avoid radiation-inducing damage.\\nResult: Combination of intraoperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy and moderate dose (40-45Gy) of external radiotherapy in the treatment of primary and recurrent colorectal cancers and retroperitoneum cancers has significantly improved tumor control. For these tumors, there were reported of 80-90% of two-year tumor control rate.\\nConclusion: Intraoperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy provides a novel curable opportunity for those tumors difficult to reach optimally tumor-controlled by traditional treatment methods, such as the tumors in pelvis or retroperitoneum cavity.',\n",

By radiographic visualization of internal organs, the correct position of fields can be obtained by physicians in relation to external landmarks. Some of areas we would like to include in treatment fields (eg. anus, neck lymph node) or to spare (eg. lens, colostomy) by cerrobend block are not located exactly at the midline of body thickness and are far from the central beam axis (near the field margin). Because of the beam divergency effect, the field margin may be too extended or too limited by different beam directions. Therefore, those areas should be marked clearly and we should especially consider the direction of simulation beam. It may be one of the crucial factors of marginal failure of treatment if we do not pay attention to it.',\n",

       " 'The purpose of studying tumor kinetics are for the prognosis of patients and for the choice of the optimal treatment. S-phase fraction (SPF) as well as ploidy status of a tumor, for example, has been used frequently for prognosis and treatment guidance in clinic. The kinetics of a tumor before and after the treatment plays an important role which may affect the outcome of the therapy. For a tumor with high SPF, either the cytotoxic drugs specific for S- or M-phase cells should be used in chemotherapy or the accelerated treatment should be adopted in radiotherapy. There are two kinds of drugs currently used for clinical chemotherapy. One of which can inhibit the activity of the enzyme required for DNA replication, such as 5-fluorouracil which kills S-phase cells by inhibiting the activity of thymydylate synthetase. The second one killed M-phase cells by destructing the organelle required for mitotic processes, such as vinblastine which breaks tubulin assembly and cyclophosphamide which results in fragmentation of synaptonemal complex. Radiotherapy, on the other way, is more effective in killing G2/M cells but less effective for S-phase cells. Both treatments, however, are not very effective for hypoxic cells, which in average accounts for 15% of solid tumors, and those cells in the GJG0 stage. The more one understands the tumor kinetics, the higher control rate one may obtain. The following four subjects and their clinical applications were discussed: cell cycle and its measuring techniques, growth fraction, potential tumor doubling time and cell loss.',\n",

       " 'Introduction: The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in dispose of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and serological evidence in NPC patients indicated that ED virus plays an important role in the development of NPC. However, there is no direct evidence that EB virus is the etiological cause of NPC. There are many Chinese medicinal herbs and foods containing ES virus inducers and tumor promoters in NPC high risk areas. Many anaerobic bacteria producing butyric acid could also be found in the nasopharynces. Both of them together with ED virus may play an important role in the development of NPC.\\nMethods: The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) gene of RB virus contained in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (CNE1, CNE3) was detected by in situ hybridization, PCR amplification, cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis.Immortalized 293 (human fetal kidney cells) transfected with CR2 were infected with B95-8 REV. These cells were transplanted into nude mice sub cutaneously. A week later, each mouse was injected with 5Ong TPA subcutaneously. In another experiment, nude mice were subcutaneously transplanted with human fetal nasopharygeal mucosa infected with REV. 200ug butyrate and 50ng TPA were injected subcutaneously once a week following the tramplantation. Tumors were examined histopathologcally. The presence of EBV DNA were determined by PCR, in situ hybridization, and nucleotide sequence analysis of EBV LMP-1 gene.\\nResults: LMP1 gene is integrated into the No.1 chromosome in CNE1, and into several chromosomes in CNE3. The exon 3 of LMP1 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned from CNE1 and CNE3. Sequence analyses of these PCR products revealed a high homology of 99.5% between B95-8 strain and CNE1, and a lower homology of 93% between B95-8 and CNE3. Poorly differentiated carcinoma was found in nude mice transplanted with EBV infected 293 cells under the influence of TPA. Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma was also found in nude mice transplanted with RBV-infected human fetal nasopharyngeal mucosa by synergistic effect of TPA and butyrate. EB virus existed in all of these carcinoma cells.\\nConclusion: The present data demonstrated for the first time that the synergistic effect of RB virus and tumor promoter can induce nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Our data also confirmed that EU virus could play an etiological role in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To analyze the treatment-related acute and late toxicities of NPC patients after hyperfractionated radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: During the period from Oct. 1991 to June 1996, 50 patients were treated using hyperfractionated radiotherapy with 120 cGy bid and 6-hour intervals. There were 35 males and 15 females with the age range of 17-79. All except 2 cases were of AJCC stage III & IV. During the treatment period, acute toxicities were recorded once a week. Late toxicities were also evaluated on every follow-up visit after completion of radiotherapy. RTOG/EORTC criteria are used to grade toxicities.\\nResults: Dry mouth was the most commonly found acute side effect affecting all patients. Acute mucositis developed in 96% of the patients, with 62% of grade 3. Nausea/vomiting occurred in 20 cases and were mostly mild except one. Moist desquamation was noted in 8 patients. Leukopenia was not frequent and mild. Body weight loss was 8.2±0.6%. For late toxicities, xerostomia was again the most common and affected all patients. Neck fibrosis was found in 13 patients (26%), mostly mild. Twelve patients developed Lhermitte's sign. No other neurological dysfunction has been noted. Hearing impairment was often associated with otitis media and occurred in about 1/ 5 of patients. Two patients had trismus, and one had radionecrosis at the posterior alveolar bone of the right mandible.\\nConclusions: Hyperfractionated radiotherapy induced a high proportion of mucositis. However, the patient tolerance was not compromised by this. Other acute toxicities resembled that after conventional radiotherapy both in frequency and severity. This also applied to late complications except one case with radionecrosis. Longer follow-up is needed before any definite conclusion can he made. At the present stage, hyperfractionated radiotherapy, with its theoretical advantages, appears to be a reasonable alternative to conventional radiotherapy for NPC patients.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose: The goal of this study is to realize the radioprotective effects of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) on KB and CHO cells.\\nMaterials and Methods: The experimental cells were assigned to divide into three groups: group A was the normal control; Cells in group C were irradiated at 24 or 48 hrs respectively after AA treatment.\\nResults: There is an inhibitory effect of AA on the growth of KB and CHO cells. The ID50 data of AA on KB and CHO cells are 2.48 and 2.11 mg/ml of culture medium respectively, roughly the same of them. The survival fractions (SF) of KB cells increased gradually after delivered AA to their culture medium at 0, 24 and 48 hrs, and then irradiated with a single fraction of 800 cGy. Similar results were also noted in CHO cells. In general, the longer of the culture period, the higher of the SF after irradiation at that culture time. Compared to the SF of group B (0 hr), there was no significant increase of SF at 24 and 48 hrs in CHO treated KB cells. It showed that there was no radioprotective effect of AA on KB cells. On the contrary, the SF of CHO cells treated with AA at 24 and 48 hrs respectively increased significantly compared to the SF of group B.\\nConclusion: The radioprotective effects of AA on CHO cell were proportional to culture time within 48 hrs after AA treatment. This radioprotective effect was not significant in KB cells, but was significant in CHO cells. The differential radioprotective effect of AA on normal cells may be used in clinical radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Using intersitial implantation, one needle implantation procedure provides for two complimentary treatment modalities of radiotherapy and hyperthermia with adequate dose and temperature distribution, subsequently improving the local control. Problems of interference of heat delivery and temperature measurement exist when we use microwave or radiofrequency as the heating source, This study aims at investigating the heat distribution using interstitial thermofuse system.\\nMaterial and Methods: Thermofuse hyperthermia system was used to study on phantom, pork and alive pigs. Volume needle implantation with 3-5 planes, 5 needles per plane were implanted. They were devided into 3 groups with 10, 12 and 15mm needle spacing. Thermocouples were used to measure the temperature distribution inside and outside implantation areas. The data were analyzed and compared.\\nResults: In the study of phantom, pork and alive pigs, the implantation volume could achieve ideal and effective hyperthermia temperatures at 10, 12 mm spacing through the adjustment of water temperature before circulation. In alive pigs, with a 15 mm needle spacing, the implanted volume could not achieve ideal temperatures. The temperatures were significantly decreased by 1.4-2.0℃in the areas near the vessels.\\nConclusion: This study shows that interstitial hyperthermia using thermofuse system is able to precisely provide effective hyperthermia temperature without the interference of physics parameters in thermo-measurement in implanted tumor areas. The accuracy of heat delivery and temperature measurement is better than other external hyperthermia systems. We estimate that the combination with radiotherapy can improve the treatment effect of solid tumors. It is expected more beneficial, especially for those solid tumors with relatively long survivals.',\n",

A homogenous muscle phantom was used. Before heating, one capacitive plate electrode was placed under the phantom and another intracavitary electrode was inserted horizontally to the center of the phantom. The temperatures were measured by thin-coated thermocouples which were placed into the phantom through angiocatheters. The catheters were arranged with the aid of a custom-made holder. Simultaneously, thermogram was performed via a computerized system.\\nResult: The result showed that the temperatures around the intracavitary device were higher than the points elsewhere in the phantom. The farther away from the intracavitary electrode a point was, the less temperature was measured. The highest temperature appeared at the anterior part of the intracavitary electrode.\\nConclusion The study revealed that the energy would concentrate around the intracavitary electrode. It may be reasonable applying an intracavitary heating device into the body cavity to treat the malignancy of vagina, cervix, esophagus, prostate, etc. However, it must be very careful to monitor the temperature around the intracavitary electrode for prevention of normal tissue injury by overheating.',\n",

In this study, we measured the output factors of each electron energy and each electron cone (except 25× 25 cm^2 applicator) of Varian Cl-l800 sn: 164 linear accelerator. The cut-out size is ranging from l×1 cm^2 to l0×10 cm^2 stepped by 1 cm for l0×10 cm^2 and 6×6 cm^2 electron cones and 15×15 cm^2 for 20×20 cm^2 cone. According to the measured data, we will observed the variation of the output factors and suggest the method for irregular electron field output correction. Materials & Methods: Cut-out BSBs(Beam-Shaping-Blocks) were made of CERROBEND alloy to put into the frame of each applicator. The output was measured with 0.0 3cc parallel plate ionization chamber be setted at the dmax of RMI PMMA solid phantom and connected to lonex Dosemaster 2590 electrometer. The readings were corrected with temperature, pressure and be normalized to its full open cone output.\\nResults: For each energy and 15×15 cm^2, 20×20 cm^2 electron cones, the output factors decreases rapidly when the cut-out size is less than 5×5 cm^2. For 10 ×10 cm^2 cone, the output is not decrease when the cut-out size is larger than 4×4 cm^2. For 6×6 cm^2 cone, the output is the same when the cut-out size is not less than 3×3 cm^2.\\nConclusion: There is no simple mathematical function just like the SAR method and Clarkson mehtod that allows us to predict the output for a given field size and electron energy. According to the results of this measurement, the output of the irregular field can be corrected by Mills method if the cutout area less than the point of curve decreasing.',\n",

Asymmetric fields of 5×10, l0×10, 15×10 cm were opened with one of the upper jaws moved to the central axis and the lower jaws opened at 10 cm symmetrically to the central axis. The output of each field was measured by a PTW-23333, 0.6 cc cylindrical ionization chamber along the off-axis center and was compared to the output of the symmetric field of the same field size along the central axis.\\nResults: The PTW-23333 Farmer chamber was used to measure the central axis dose for both symmetric and asymmetric fields.

The divergent effect of field-to-field junction, between bilateral opposing field in upper neck and anterior lower neck, are always noted. Over (under) dosage in junction area is always concerned by physicians. Further more, supraclavicular and tangential field junction in breast cancer treatments also encounter the same problem.

The proximal electrode surface was placed at the depth of D(subscript max) to measure the delivered dose of each energy, each electron cone at SSD=100, 110, 120cm respectively. The ESSD of each electron cone and each energy was calculated according to the inverse-square-law using the data of SSD 100 and 120cm.\\nResults: The lower beam energies and the smaller electron cone, the ESSD become shorter. The same nominal energy, the larger cone size, the ESSD get more close to 100cm. The same electron cone size, the larger electron energy, the ESSD did not change regularly. The ESSD formed by MLC type electron cone varies smoothly. The scatter from Kapton type ion chamber is smaller than that from Mica type ones. Thus, the ESSD formed from the Kapton type machine is closed to 100cm.\\nConclusion: The measured ESSDs of the three linear accelerators will be used to calculate the monitor units in the extend SSD electron beam treatment.

The film changes from colorless to blue by dye polymerization without processing, upon exposure to ionization from 0-50 Gy. The dose distribution patterns of 4 non-coplanar irradiation with the Gafchromic film were compared with the ones from the verification film which was only exposed with 250 cGy.\\nResult: The Gafchromic film appears to be a better choice for actual dose measurement in the medium with avoiding potential uncertainties found in most of silver halide films such as light exposure, processing time, developer concentration etc. However, to obtain reasonable good optical densities in the Gafchromic film, there is a need to offer irradiation about 10 Gy that is not practically achievable in the clinical settings. The accuracy study of the chromic film was found to be less 0.5% in error comparing with the one from the verification film.\\nConclusion: It is clinically possible to obtain an accuracy of 1mm on determining the physical center in the linac-based radiosurgery. For actual dose measurement in the body, the chromic film offers a good test tool for dosimetry and quality assurance.',\n",

The possible cause of the disease is the deficiency of adenosine deaminase. The traditional treatment is to inject the irradiated red blood cells or the polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase. The strategy of gene therapy is to transfect human T cells with retroviral vector that contains normal perspective gene and then to deliver these transfected human T cells back into the patient's circulation.

All were evaluated for toxicity and response. The median age was 62 years old, the median pretreatment weight loss was 6 kilograms, and the median serum albumin level was 3.7 gm/dl. Grade III and IV leukopenia were noted in 7 patients and 2 patients, respectively. Three patients had Grade IV thrombocytopenia. Seven patients (44%) showed complete remission on restaging. The 2-year survival rate is 37%.\\nConclusion: This treatment regimen provides a high local tumor control. However, the toxicity of the treatment was unacceptably high.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The goal of this research is to study the influence of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) and desmethylmisonidazole (DMM) on the radiobiological effects of CHO cells and then as a basis of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer patients.\\nMaterials and Methods: This study was designed to investigate the influence of AA and DMM on radiobiological effects of CHO cells. Combination of AA (with different concentration) and DMM (with constant concentration) was also used to evaluate their radiobiological effects. In the same way, the radiobiological effects of combined DMM (with different concentration) and AA (with constant concentration) was also evaluated.\\nResults: The results showed that there are radioprotective effects of AA and radiosensitizing effects of DMM on CHO cells. However, the radiosensitizing effect is significantly greater than radioprotective effect when both drugs were combined used. In addition, the higher concentrations of AA were, the greater it protected CHO cells from radiation under constant concentrations of DMM. On the contrary, the higher concentration of DMM was, the greater it sensitized CHO cells to radiation under constant concentrations of AA.\\nConclusion: The effect of combined AA (0.025 mg/ml) and DMM (0.5-10 mM) on CHO cells is radiosensitization. When DMM is absent, the radioprotective effect of AA is expressed.',\n",

All of them were squamous cell carcinoma. The age of the patients ranged from 34 to 84 years old with the highest incidence at the 60-69 age group. There were 128 male patients and 5 female patients with male to female ratio as 26:1. The numbers of patients in stage I to IV were 25, 21, 22, and 65, respectively. Stage IV patients accounted for about half of the cases. The numbers of supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic cancers were 51, 72, and 10, respectively. Glottic type accounted for more than half of the cases. Fifty-seven patients received primary radiotherapy. The other 76 patients received surgery before radiotherapy.\\nResults: The overall actuarial five-year survival rate was 54.7%. The actuarial five-year survival rates for patients of stages Ⅰ, Ⅱ,Ⅲ and Ⅳ were 78.7%, 58.3%, 54%, and 44.4%, respectively. The five-year survival rates for supraglottic, glottic and subglottic cancers were 34.7%, 70.5%, and 38.9%, respectively.\\nConclusion: Recurrence after radiotherapy was salvaged by surgery satisfactorily in stages I and II, but the prognosis was poor for recurrent patients with initial stages III and IV. A life-long follow-up after radical radiotherapy is essential for early detection of recurrence and earlier salvage to improve the therapeutic result.',\n",

Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy were also given to 55 and 40 patients, respectively.\\nResults: The 5-year disease-free survival rates for stage Ⅱ and Ⅲ patients were 80% and 31%, respectively. The 5-year local control rates for stage Ⅱ and Ⅲ patients were 98% and 72%, respectively. Thirty-seven patients had distant rnetastases. Bone was the most common site. Thirteen percent of grade 1 and 18% of grade 2 late skin complication were noted. Late grade 1 complication of lung was noted in 6% of patients. In patients of high risk group (tumor size of larger than 5 cm and more than 3 positive axillary nodes metastases), the 5-year disease-free survival and local control rates were 10% and 37%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, more than 3 positive axillary nodes metastases was a strong prognostic factor for disease. free survival rates (p＜0.0001) and local control rates (p=0.0096). Tumor size of larger than 5 cm was also recognized as independent prognostic factors for local control rates (p=0.0213).\\nConclusion: Electron beam irradiation for postmastectomy of breast cancer has been proven with good local control in this study. It is compatible with the study in many reports. This technique has the advantages of easy setup, homogeneous dose distribution, and less pulmonary complication. The outcomes of high risk group patients are poor, more aggressive management may be needed for these patients.',\n",

Combined surgery and radiotherapy were used to treat pituitary macroadenoma and recurrent pituitary adenoma. The object of this study was to investigate the survival rate and prognostic factors using combined surgery and radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between 1983 and 1993, 47 patients with pathologically proven pitiuitary adenoma received radiation therapy at Mackay Memorial Hospital. Of these patients, 25 were males and 22 were females. The median age was 42.5 years with a range of 21 to 71 years. Visual disturbance (72%) and headache (60%) were the most common symptoms. Irradiation was delivered with 6-MV photon or Co-60 gamma ray, 5 days per week, at a dose of 180 to 200 cGy per fraction. The total tumor dose ranged from 4140 cGy to 6500 cGy with a median dose of 5800 cGy. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 11 years with a median time of 5.6 years.\\nResults: 47 patients were divided into two groups by their tumor status before radiation therapy. Group A patients, consisting of 42 patients were underwent incomplete resection and radiation therapy as the primary treatment. Among these patients, 4 patients were lost during follow-up, and 3 patients experienced recurrence of the tumor. Five patients died during the follow-up period, 4 patients for uncontrolled disease and one patient for CVA. The overall 5-year survival rate was 87% and the relapse-free survival rate was 93%. Group (B) patients, cansisting of 5 patients were treated for recurrence after surgery. Of these patients, one died due to tumor compression 124 months after radiotherapy, but the remaining 4 cases are still doing well.\\nConclusions: Using the Log-rank test, gender, age and dose are not significant prognostic factors. In brief, we found that appropriate surgery and postoperative radiation therapy could achieve good local control and may replace radical surgery as the standard treatment for pituitary macroadenoma.',\n",

The goal of this study was to increase our understanding of the relative influence that specific variables have on the outcome of patients.\\nMethods and Materials: Forty-two patients with intracranial malignant gliomas (17 with anaplastic astrocytomas and 25 with glioblastoma multiforme), treated by surgery and postoperative radiotherapy at Mackay Memorial Hospital from April 1985 through April 1995, were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-six men and 16 women with a median age of 44 years (range, 10 to 70 years) were entered in the study. Seventeen clinical factors (age at surgery; sex; initial presenting symptoms of headaches, mental changes, seizure, visual changes, motor deficits, sensory changes, and speech difficulties; preoperative performance status based on the Karnofsky scale; the extent of surgical removal; postoperative radiotherapy dose; the presence of brain edema, brain midline shift, and hematoma formation; tumor she; duration of initial symptoms), and 2 histological factors (histological grade; tumor cystic formation) were analyzed to investigate their importance in predicting length of survival. Data were analyzed using the Cox proportional harzards analysis or Chi-square test.\\nResults: The overall median survival time was 18.7 months. The median survival time was 25.4 months for anaplastic astrocytoma and 14.2 months for glioblastoma multiforme Four pretreatment variables including histological grade, age, sex and the extent of tumor resection (subtotal or total) were found to have a statistically significant effect on survival when analyzed together by the Cox multivariate regression model. Univariate analysis by the Chi-square test identified the presenting neurological symptoms of mental changes and motor deficits as having an adverse effect on survival.\\nConclusions: The authors conclude that histological grade, age, sex, extent of tumor resection, and the presenting symptoms of mental changes or motor deficits were important prognostic parameters in malignant gliomas. By stratifying patients into more homogeneous subgroups with favorable or unfavorable prognostic factors, treatment can be specially tailored for different subgroups.',\n",

A phantom with flow is designed, namely, one silicone tube inserted into a homogenous muscle phantom. The temperature to be achieved is 43℃. It was measured by thin- coated thermocouples which are inserted into phantom through angiocatheter. The catheters were arranged with the aid of self-design holder. Simutaneously, thermogram was done via the computerized system.\\nWe compare the thermal distribuation in two different enviorments: 1. Phantom without flow as a control arm, 2. Phantom with single silicone tube. The flow rates of water through silicone tubes are controlled by a microtube pump.\\nResult: The control arm demonstrated there was a tendency that the temperature of upper part of the phantom was lower than lower part. In experimental group, progressively increased velocity of the flow will also increase the ability of heat conduction. This phenomenon was not observed when the flow rate reached 150.3 ml/mm.\\nConclusion: Water flow played an important role in thermal distribution. The higher the velocity of the flow, the more increased ability of heat conduction was noted.',\n",

The scattered radiations are resulted from scattering from the collimators and modifiers, photon leakage through the treatment head of the machine, and scattering within the patient from the treatment beams. \\nMaterial & Methods: The Rando phantom is irradiated according the treatment protocol of nasopharyngeal cancer patients. The Farmer dosimeter and Thermoluminescent dosimeter are used to measure the gonad dose. The Farmer dosineler in NE 2503/3 with 0.6 c.c. lonizing chamber and the material of TLD is HF power. \\nResult: Using the Rando phantom measurements, the gonad dose is about 2.18 cGy when a dose of 1800 cGy is given to the head and neck area. The gonad dose may be reduced by 75% (from 2.18 cGy to 0.54 cGy) when the abdomen of the Rando phantom is shielded by 6 cm lead bolcks.

For the use of clinical evaluation, scatter radiation to normal tissue was measured with an Alderson anthromorphic phantom simulating breast cancer radiotherapy. \\nMaterial and method: Treatment machines included a Mitsubishi linear accelerator (6 MV) and a AECL Cobalt-60 teletherapy unit. The scatter dose to the brain, eye, salivary gland, thyroid gland, lung, stomach, pancreas, kidney, ovary, testis, and opposite breast was measured. Result: Measurement results indicated that if the affected breast received 5000 cGy tumor dose by irradiation with 6 MV X-ray then the other organs except the opposite breast would absorb a scatter dose ranging between 6 cGy to 246 cGy. Incidental radiation to the opposite breast was measured under 10 different situations using diverse wedges on the linear accelerator (6 MV) and a Cobalt.60 teletherapy unit. The measured scatter dose to the opposite breast ranged from 64 cGy to 425 cGy. We also found out that larger wedge angles deliver a higher scatter dose to the opposite breast. \\nConclusion: From the result of our experiment, we conclude: 1) The scatter dose outside of the primary beam decreased with increasing distance from the irradiated site. 2) When wedges were used, the scatter dose to opposite breast increased, 3) Using the larger wedge angle would deliver the higher scatter dose to opposite breast.',\n",

Before radiotherapy, body weight (kg), appetite score, performance status, biochemical parameters and hematological parameters were evaluated. The above clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed and recorded every other week. All patients received 6 MV X-ray or Co60-ray for full course of radiotherapy, 64.8-75.6 Gy/7-9 weeks. \\nResult: Thirty-five patients were enrolled in Megace group and 30 patients in control group. At the 4th, 6th and 8th week, as radiation dose escalated, the Megace group had less body weight loss, than the control group (p=0.0l2, 0.003, 0.008, respectively). Significant lower appetite score was noted in control group as compared with Megace group (p=0.03, 0.01, 0.004, respectively). However, there were no significant difference in the change of prealbumin and albumin level between these two groups at the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th week (p＞0.005, respectively). \\nConclusion: Low dose megestrol acetate can significantly decrease the degree of body weight loss and deterioration of the appetite status for the head and neck cancer patients receiving conventional radiotherapy.',\n",

       " 'Seral IgA titer to gene products of Epstein-Barr virus is prevalently elevated in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, an indication of EBV infection. Pathologically, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes that could be attracted by the presence of EBY in the NPC cells also increased immensely in the neighborhood of tumor nest. In a glance, EBV seemed to induce both cellular and humoral immune response. However, the immunocompetence of patients inversely decreased following the progression of the disease.\\nInterleukin-l0 (IL-l0), a potent cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor, suppresses function of T cells and NK cells ns well as that of monocytes and macrophages, the major components of cellular immune response. Besides its suppression on cellular immunity, IL-b stimulates B cells to enhance their viability, cell proliferation, class II MHC expression and immunoglobulin secretion, a hallmark of humoral immune response. Interestingly, sequence of a EBV late gene, UCIIF1, is highly homologous to that of both mouse and human IL-10(BCRF1 gene product is now designated as vIL-10). It may exert a similar function like that of JL-10. The activity of vIL-10 may explain the unusual seral phenomena and the aggregated non-functional lymphocytes surrounding the tumor nest. Anthor factor affecting the cellular immunity is the presence of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) that will compete with the membrane-bound IL-2R and desensitize the immune response. With these leads, the authors will discuss the subject ”the role of Epstein-Barr virus infection and the immunocompetence of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer” in the following catogories: EBV-associated diseases and oncogenesis, virus-cell interaction, cell culture model, synergistic effect between viral and other risk factors, latent infection or the reactivated infection, and abrogation of immunocompetence and tumor progression.

The strategies for improving the outcome include better local control as well as effective management of occult metastases already present at diagnosis. Radiotherapy has always been the standard treatment for these stages. The addition of other modalities including surgery, hypoxic cell sensitizer, hyperbaric oxygen, or neutron therapy has met with limited or no success, or has been associated with an increased morbidity. The role of chemotherapy, either as single agent or in combination, has been extensively evaluated in advanced or recurrent disease.\\nInduction or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is one of the novel therapeutic approaches. Various regimens have been used, mostly cisplatin-based combinations. Several investigators conducted phase II trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Some of these trials showed positive result. Nevertheless, some failed to demonstrate any benefit in terms of locoregional relapse and/or survival\\nAt present, the optimum regimen that lends to a maximum efficacy and a minimum toxicity remains to be determined. We have to learn whether the induction chemotherapy eventually improves survivals or is yet another approach that just demonstrates good responses without impact on survival.',\n",
       " \"A stereotactic high-dose-rate brachytherapy technique has recently been implemented for the treatment of malignant gliomas. A Cosman-Roberts-Wells (CRW) base ring is attached to the patient's skull with a CT localization frame attached to the base ring. The patient undergoes a contrast enhanced CT scanning. The CT images are transferred to the three-dimensional stereotactic brachytherapy treatment planning system (Brain-SCAN) through optical disc. Then the pre-plan is generated to determine the number of catheters, the location of each catheter, the source positions in each catheter and the implant time. The goal is to provide a steep dose fall off outside the target volume while providing the best possible dose homogeneity within the target volume. Once the plan is approved, the patient is taken to the operation room. According to the pre-plan data, neurosurgeons make a small hole by twist-drill on the skull and then place the catheters into the desired location. Later on, the real positions of catheters in the brain are verified by orthogonal radiographics and compare with the preplanned positions. After adjusting the implant time and position of each seed to compromise the position deviation of catheters, the patient is treated with MicroSelectron unit. High activity Ir-192 source is afterloaded into the catheters by remote-control system. Based on our preliminary experience, a phase I/II clinical study has been initiated.\",\n",
       " 'The purpose of the present paper is to evaluate the feasibility and patient tolerance of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in advanced or inoperable lung cancer patients. Thirteen patients, all of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) except one, were treated with 120 cGy bid hyperfractionated radiotherapy. The age range were between 37 and 84 years, with 12 of them older than 60. Except one medically inoperable T2N0M0 patient, all the remaining 11 NSCLC patients were either locally advanced or had local-regional recurrence. Patients received 4200-4500 cGy to the mediastinum and 7000 cGy to the primary lesion. Minimum and maximum follow-up was 1 and 34 months, respectively. Seven patients developed dysphagia/sore throat during irradiation. Nausea/vomiting was infrequent and mild. Radiation pneumonitis was the single significant chronic side effect up to the time of analysis. Eleven patients required some medication during the post-radiotherapy period for either severe cough or dyspnea. Ten needed steroid. Chronic pleural effusion that persisted for more than 6 months was observed in 6 patients. This was manageable in all patients. No patient was hospitalized because of radiation-induced pneumonitis. There were 2 CR and 11 PR/SD. Local recurrence has developed in 2. Distant metastasis has been documented in 5 patients who were initially MO. Patient tolerance and local control were good. Hyperfractionated radiotherapy, 120 cGy bid, with a total dose of 4500 cGy to the mediastinum and 7000 cGy to the primary lesion, is a feasible and tolerable regimen for lung cancer patients.',\n",

       " 'Radiotherapy have an important role for treating the intra-thoracic malignant disease. The depth dose distribution and the width of the penumbra within the lung tissue are quite different from ordinary soft tissue owing to the entity of extra low density of the lung parenchyma. This experiment was designed to study three most popular energies which including Co-60, 6-, and 10-MV X-rays. Film dosimetry method had been used with different phantoms. There are three different kinds of phantom to simulate unit-density soft tissue, chest wall with lung, & chest wall with lung and mediastinum, respectively. The definition of penumbra is 20% to 80% dosage of the dose profile in the central plane. We used Kodak V films for recording the different layers of depth in test phantom, that were 2,4,6,8,& 10 cm, respectively. Comparing the size of penumbra between unit-density and lung-density phantom, the Co-60, 6-, and 10-MV X-rays increased -5.4% to -30.9%, -9.7% to 28.3%, and -2.7% to 91.8%, respectively. In the same condition, there is not too much different with and without the part of mediastinum simulator. The depth dose of lung parenchyma will increase -1.0% to 23.0% for Co-60, 0.5% to 14.0% for 6-MV X-rays, and 0.5% to 7.5% for 10-MV X-rays. In physical point of view, when the energies getting higher (ex. 10-MVX), the size of penumbra within the lung will be more widened than ordinary data. Clinically, if we wanted to use these kinds of energy, we must reserve a larger safe margin around the tumor. Although the lower energy (ex. Co-60) does not have above problem, but the absorbed dose within the lung will get higher than expected if correction does not apply to the calculation.',\n",
       " \"Using the infra orbital portals in the treatment of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma allows radiation oncologists to reduce the dosage to the temporal lobes, middle and inner ears, and temporomandibular joints, therefore, the morbidities of normal tissues can he minimized. It has been thought difficult to verify these portals by using the traditional simulation techniques and films. This study is to develop an indirect method to accurately verify the oblique infraobital portals. We sent the NPC patient for CT scan with a mask and immobilization devices as in simulation position. Serial axial cuts are used to delineate the tumor margin. A midline is drawn at all cuts of images at the nasopharynx level. Use a paper strip with same magnification rate of 5cm as CT image's as the portal width covering the most nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal areas, then get the cross point of the portal central line and the midline of axial cuts as the rotation center. Rotate the paper strip in the angle of 40-50 degree bilaterally to cover the nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal areas on the contralateral side and the most nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal areas on the ipsilateral side without irradiating the spinal cord. Then rotate the paper strip again to the horizontal (true lateral) position. Mark the posterior margin of the treatment portals on the image of axial cuts. Connect these markers into a line as the posterior margin of true lateral portal. With a suitable collimator angulation and the necessary block making, an indirect method for verification of this position is obtained. This technique allows us to correctly irradiate the oblique infraorbital portal with reliable verification. Applying indirect verification of oblique infraorbital portal in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, is feasible and reliable. This study shows that indirect verification for delivering the oblique infraorbital portal is not only a simple, convenient procedure for the patients, technologists and physicians, but also an effective way to achieve the therapeutic gain in the treatment of nasopharyugeal carcinoma.\",\n",

Because clonogenic assay in studying drug-radiation interaction is not sensitive enough to detect the viability change caused by low dose radiation, an in vitro apoptotic assay is used to evaluate the synergistic effect of taxol and low dose radiation as well as to arrange the optimal schedule for using taxol in radiotherapy. The growth inhibition curve and radiation survival curve were determined with or without taxol on HeLa cells. HeLa cells were treated with various doses of taxol for 2 or 24 hrs. Radiation of 2Gy was given at various time intervals following taxol treatment. Percentages of apoptotic cells were calculated according to nucleus morphology after propidium iodide staining was counted by fluorescence microscope. The proportion of cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity of taxol is not dose-dependent with killing efficiency most obvious at low dose. However, the increase of apoptotic cells and cells at sub-G1 phase following taxol treatment are correlated with the taxol concentration and the timing to irradiation. The maximal effect of taxol-2Gy combination assessed by percentage of apoptosis and sub-G1 phase proportion was resulted from low dose (IC10) taxol for 2hr and then radiation 24hr later. Under such condition, taxol functioned as a cell-cycle selective radiosensitizer. (Partial supported by VGH 83-158 and D0H84-HR-202)',\n",

All 24 patients were to undergo extensive resection and then to receive a primary course of adjuvant craniospinal axis irradiation with a local posterior fossa boost. The anatomical extent of the disease was classified according to the Chang staging system. Headache, vomiting and an unsteady gait were the major presentations in this series. The overall 5-year survival rate was 58% respectively. In addition, the overall 5-year survival rate was statistically higher in females than in males (73% vs 46%, P=0.03), in early-stage tumors (T1 & T2) than in late-stage tumors (T3 & T4) (71% vs 40%, P=0.066), and in patients who received a dose of 50 Gy or more to the posterior fossa than in those who received a lower dose (73% vs 33%, P=0.05). The extent of surgery had no impact on the survival rate (P=0.13). Patients older than 5-years of age had a higher 5-year survival rate but it was not statistically significant (71% vs 40%, P=0.066). The overall relapse rate was 50% in our series with only 3 eases survived in the follow-up.\\nFrom the literature review and the results of this series, we can conclude that by more than 50 Gy posterior fossa irradiation, the overall survival rate has much improved, so the late sequellae have become an important subject. However, there is still poor outcome in advanced disease and recurrent disease. The optimal selection criteria are urgently required to reduce long-term complications and to increase survival in poor outcome groups.',\n",

Theoretically, there are infinite arrangements of position and exposure time of the radioactive source for a given treatment. In order to produce satisfactory isodose curves, the best number and allocation of the source position and exposure time must be predetermined. Optimization of number, location and exposure time of the source can be calculated involving linear equations. Unfortunately, by direct calculation the exposure time can be negative for some positions. In this study, a mathematical method is developed to calculate the number and proper positions of the source and the exposure time in each position, the dose distribution can be plotted out by a plotter of CMS treatment planning system, By this algorithm we match the dose requirement as clinically needed. For practical consideration, a table of source dwelling-time for cylindrical dose contour is constructed. The dose distributions were found to corresponding within 4% as initially requested. Furthermore, using the multiple linear equation one can determine the position and exposure time for up to three needles on single plane brachytherapy. This principles can be applied to more complicated treatment plannings.',\n",

In our hospital radiosurgery with the Leksell Gamma Knife was used to treat AVM, acoustic neuroma, meningioma, glioma and other benign or malignant brain tumors. To deal with 201 cobalt-60 sources of the Gamma Knife, the complex dosimetry was performed using specially developed computer software (KULA). The treatment planning with KULA for a recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer after external beam radiotherapy is presented. After initial rough planning with 12 shots to cover the tumor, repeated revisions of coordinates and weights of most shots resulted in a 50% isodose curve matching the tumor contour in 3 dimensions. The possibility of neurological complication is low due to the relative low dose (＜30%) to the neighboring optic nerve and brain stem. Though the result of this laborious and prolonged treatment planning is good, the amenity and efficiency of using KULA are unsatisfactory for this large and irregular shaped tumor. When stacking of multiple isocenters or shots in 3 dimensions to fill the tumor volume, the melded isodose curves can be very differnt from the simple combination of individual curves and trials and errors are inevitable. For efficient planning of large and irregular shaped tumors with KULA, it is essential to be familiar with the principle of allocation and methods of fine adjustment of parameters of shots.',\n",

Elements involoved in gene therapy are recombinant drugs, informational molecules, genetic immunomodulation, detoxified molecules, targeting drugs and replacement genes. Radiation may induce expression of certain genes such as jun, fos, NFkB, Egr-1, PKC and several cytokines, some may enhance killing effect of cancer cells while some may protect normal cells. Radiation-associated gene therapy is under development. Gene therapy is not risk-free. Potential risks include insertional mutagenesis leading to cancer, environmental pollution of infectious recombinant virus, toxic shock caused by viremia, contamination of human body with deleterious viruses or microorganisms and transfer of nonviral exogenous genetic materials. Therefore, in the study of gene therapy, gene transfer into tumor cells in vivo should be efficent and stable and should ensure safety for both patients and staff.',\n",
       " 'Background: Patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUPS) and massive liver metastasis have a poor prognosis. Taxol is one of the most promising anticancer agent developed in the last decade. The anticancer activity of Taxol in CUPS is unknown. The objective of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of Taxol treatment in CUPS.\\nMethod: Patients with CUPS with massive liver metastases were eligible. Taxol 175 mg/m^2 was administered by 3-hour intravenous infusion every three weeks. Patients were evaluated for response and toxicity.\\nResults: Three patients were studied. The first two patients had failed previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The first patient had partial response to Taxol therapy. He tolerated Taxol well. Taxol was escalated to 230 mg/m^2 without G.CSF support. The second patient, a hepatitis B carrier, received one course of Taxol treatment and had stable disease. He tolerated treatment well but developed reactivation of hepatitis B virus with ful-minant hepatitis. The third patient tolerated treatment well but response was too early to be evaluated. The overall toxicities of Taxol treatment were tolerable. The major toxicity was myelosuppression. The dose-limiting toxicity was myalgia in one patient. No nausea, vomiting, major organ toxicity, hypersensitivity reaction or heart block was noted.\\nConclusions: The preliminary results of this pilot study suggest that it is feasible to administer Taxol with full dose of 175 mg/m^2 in 3-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks to CUPS patients. Taxol treatment was well tolerated. The anticancer response observed in this study was the first report of effectiveness of taxol in the treatment of CUPS patient with massive liver metastases, and refractory to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.',\n",
       " 'From June 1989 to August 1991, ten patients with invasive bladder cancers (6 were inoperable and 4 refused surgery) were treated with concomitant cisplatin (25mg/m^2 weekly for 6 cycles) and irradiation (median 61.5 Gy) after transurethral resection. Their median age was 74 years old. The complete response rate was 100% within median follow-up time of 33 months (range: 17 to 40 months). One out of the ten treated patients had local recurrence 7 months after treatment. The overall local tumor control rate was 90%. All the patients preserved their bladders. Two patients developed distant metastasis, one in bone and one in brain. No significant acute toxic effects related to irradiation and chemotherapy occurred. Four patients had late sequelae from treatment. One had hemorrhagic cystitis and the other three developed bilateral hydronephrosis due to ureter stenosis. The one-year and two-year actuarial survival rates were 100%and 89% respectively. Our results demonstrate that concomitant cisplatin and irradiation is a tolerable, effective treatment for old-aged patients with invasive bladder cancer. High local control rate and bladder preservation rate can also be achieved by this combined-modality treatment.',\n",

Nine patients had palpable inguinal lymph nodes. One to two courses of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin-C were given during radiotherapy in 16 patients and cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin combination in one patient. External beam radiotherapy was delivered with single daily fraction between 1.8 and 2.0Gy up to a median total dose of 55Gy. Fifteen patients (88%) achieved complete response and 12 of them remain local recurrence free with a median follow-up time of 32 months (range:9-95 months). Eight of this 12 patients were alive without evidence of disease, 3 developed distant metastasis and one died of intercurrent disease. Five patients did not achieve local contral, three of them received abdomino-perineal resection. Two died of local tumor relapse and one died of distant metastasis but with local control. The other 2 patients without local contral died of local and distant diseases. The overall 2-year actuarial survival rate is 68%. Twelve of 17 patients was colostomy-free and anal function was preserved in 10 of 12 patients with local control. We conclude that concurrent chemoradiotherapy can provide good local control and preserve the anal sphincter function in most of anal cancer patients.',\n",
       " 'Chemotherapy is a very important method in cancer treatment. Clinically, the patient would suffer from lack of adequate venous access for administration of chemotherapeutic agents after multiple courses of chemotherapy. The problem is resolved by the extensive use of venous injection ports. Injection ports are usually implanted in the anterior chest wall, with their catheter inserted into the subclavian vein. If the patient must receive radiotherapy over these areas, the radiation dose under injection ports would be lower. This paper trys to find out the influence of metallic or silicon injection ports on the dose distribution of K-rays and electron beams. Two different kinds of radiation beams, with different energy levels, were used in these experiments. They were 6MV and 10 MV K-rays, and 9, 12, 15 and 18MeV eletron beams. In order to understand the influence of injection ports, all dose measurements were made at different depths under the ports. The data revealed that the presence of injection ports alters the dose uniformity and decreased the depth dose. For example, the dose underlying metal injection portals at 2.5cm depth reduced to 37% when 9MeV electrons are used. This paper recommends that 1.The injection port should be implanted outside the potential irradiation field. 2. Avoid irradiation of the injection port whenever possible. 3. Use silicon-made injections port. 4. Avoid selecting electron beams for treatment.',\n",

Seven patients were previously untreated stage III A (3) and stage III B (4), and one was recurrent after surgery. All patients presented with intraluminal tumor, and received external radiation ranging 40 to 60Gy regarding the therapeutic intents. Brachytherapies were usually performed twice at the median and end of the course of teletherapy, with prescribed dose 8 to 10Gy at 1cm off the cather center.

The influence of the cancer to the society, besides the death itself has almost reached the panic level. Because of its chronic property, the family afflicted not only has to consider the medical cost, but also has to face how to deal with the psychological despair and the thrill of the death.\\nModern medicine has already invested a great deal of man power and money into the investigation of cancer and the cause of the cancer has been gradually unveiled. Also, because of the advances of modern technology, the diagnostic method of cancer has progressed enormously. However, in concern of the cancer treatment, the present methods such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and immunotherapy, can only beneifit about 50% of the patients. These patients also have to be the patients of whom the tumors were luckily discovered at the earlier stages. Those at the advanced stage were usually ended up with death.\\nBecause the treatment efficacy and prognosis are low, the treatment cost is high and the procedure of the treatment is painful, a great portion of patients, especially those at the terminal stage, will then turn to seek help from the other way including the untraditional folk medicine. In fact, traditional Chinese medicine has its unique feature. The ingredients of many Chinese medicinal herbs have been purified and characterized. The treatment strategy and treatment plan that aimed at how to ”solidify the basis and nourish the origin” were novel to that of the modern medicine.

There were 15 cases of ovarian dysgerminoma treated at Taipei and Kaohsiung Veteran General Hospitals from 1971to 1993. The mean age is 23 years old. Among them, 13 patients were primary tumors and the other 2 patients were recurrent ones. Four patients were in Stage Ⅰ, three patients Stage Ⅱ, four patients Stage Ⅲ and one patient Stage Ⅳ. All patients except the one with pulmonary metastases received surgery. Eight patients received postoperative radiotherapy and ten patients received chemotherapy respectively. Only one patient was lost for follow-up. The other patients were followed up regularly for at least 3 months. The longest follow.up duration was 16 years. Three patieuts who initially presented with pulmonary metastases, lymphatic metastases or local recurrent disease had died. The local control rates were 100% for Stage I-Il diseases and for diseases treated by post-operative radiother. apy. According to this analysis, current conservative treatment seems not suitable for most patients because 66% of them were in Stage II or beyond. In addition, it still needs longer follow- up to evaluate whether adjuvant chemotherapy can take the place of post-operative radiotherapy. Therefore, it seems not appropriate to adapt conservative treatments for the control of disease and conservation of fertility under such condition that the patients are mostly in higher stages. Before there are sufficient cases to support the effects of chemotherapy, to treat ovarian dysgerminoma with surgery and post-operative radiotherapy still works quiet well according to the experiences of Veteran General Hospital.',\n",

Nuclides with very large neutron capture cross section are introduced into a special chemical form and are admitted into a tumor patient. This compound will penetrate into the tumor and tumor cells and will stay there for a sufficient long time. The tumor is then irradiated with a neutron beam. The special nuclide in the chemical will capture the neutron and will split into two smaller fragments then release energy. The range of the fragment is smaller than 10 pm. So only the tumor cell and its nearest neighbor cells will be damaged, and the tumor is cured. The main application of NCT is the treatment of brain tumors and malignant melanomas. Recently there are some studies on NCT for hepatomas. We discuss the choice of nuclides suitable chemical compounds, neutron beams and radiation dosimetry.',\n",

For the extensive chemistry of boron is such that it can be incorporated into a multitude of different chemical structures, there have been many kinds of boron compounds synthesized for potential use in BNCT.

Drugs with different shapes of survival curves will require differently planned dose scheduling. A human bladder cancer cell line (647V) was used in these preliminary experiments.\\nThe clonogenic survival curves for 5 different anticancer drugs (CDDP, TDDP, BLM, VP-16, BCNU) for 647V cells were determined experimentally and found to fit a polynomial survival curve model over a limited range, the α, β, γ model, with s=exp[-(αD+βD2 +γD3)], where D is dose, and is a function of both concentration and time. Equations are derived for schedule changes and clonogenic kill calculations. This approach provides a new method of optimizing dosage schedules. It also provides a common language between medical oncologists and radiation oncologists in survival curve analysis. Although these preliminary experiments were limited to one human cancer cell line and five chemotherapeutic drugs, the concept appears to be worth testing further. We are now reporting the first psrt of this research work-the modeling.',\n",

Clinically, this tumor is characterized by its rapid deteriorated course with reported 2-year survival rate rarely exceeding 15%. From the biological viewpoint, GBM is well-known by its rapid proliferating activity, short doubling time, and intrinsic radioresistence. With the recent advances in radiation biology, a new altered fraction treatment called multiple daily fractionated radiation therapy (MDF-RT) by shortening the overall treatment time, is therefore designed to counteract the rapid proliferating characteristics of GBM.\\nWe initiated a prospective trial of MDF-RT in patients with GBM at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between January 1981 and June 1988. Twenty one patients were treated with MDF-RT schedule, consisting of 28-35Gy whole brain irradiation in 14 fr (2-2.5Gy per fr) given 3 fr per day with 4-hour split intervals. The treatment had a break of 3-4 weeks and followed by cone-down boost 6-20Gy in normal fraction. Another 34 patients, referred to as control group, were treated with conventional daily fraction, consisting of 50Gy whole brain irradiation and l0Gy cone-down boost. The actuarial 1-year and 2-year suryival rate were 32% and 5% respectively for MDF-RT group, 38% and 4% respectively for control group.

       " 'That the radiotherapy with hyperfractionation technique can improve the local tumor control rate has been reported in lots of literature in therapy for advanced head and neck cancers and other cancers but little in gynecological cancers. In 1992 we treated 2 cases with carcinoma of the uterine cervix by two fractions per day. Case I had recurrent tumor in the vaginal cuff and case II had FIGO stage IIB disease. Both cases received hyperfractionation with 1.8 Gy from AP and PA portals in the morning and 1.2 Gy from bilateral opposing portals in the afternoon at interval of at least 6 hours. We delivered up to 45 Gy in lsdays, rested for 1-2 weeks, and then changed the dose as in the conventional radiotherapy with 2 Gy per day. Case I totally received 72.6 Gy in 43 fractions in 59 days. Case II received 65 Gy in 40 fractions in 45 days. Case II also received concomitant chemotherapy with 30 mg cisplatin for 3 days in the second week of radiotherapy as a radiation sensitizer and intracavitary brachytherapy to the uterine cavity with 500 cGy to point A for each treatment and totally for 5 treatments after external radiotherapy. After radiotherapy both cases developed moderate to severe acute reactPons including diarrhea, tenesmus and low white count in 2 weeks of the hyperfractionation treatment. But the acute reactions were soon recovered after a rest of 1-2 weeks. In our follow-up as of July 1993, there was no late complication and the case were with good local controland without distant metastasis up to 17 months. The literature, review demonstrated only 2 reports regarding hyperfractionation of the gynecological cancershad been reported. The local tumor control in is 2 reports did not show any significant improvement and the increased acute normal tissue reactions showed in one report. In conclusion, hyperfractionation technique for gynecological cancers may induce more acute reactions but may not increase the local control rate, so, it is not frequently applied in the therapy for gynecological cancers.']"

       " 'c': '目的：研究目的是期望在使用阻擋參數設計與優化螺距之螺旋刀放射治療技術於左側乳癌的病症的同時，危急器官劑量比起傳統乳癌對照技術能獲得有效的降低。材料與方法：本研究是探討左側乳癌患者做螺旋刀治療計劃時參考An-Cheng Shiau 2014之限制阻擋參數設定並搭配優化螺距設定，目的是期望達到較佳的順行度並且降低附近危急器官劑量。首先，需先得知定位中心位置與實際治療靶體積之位置中軸偏差距離，再參考Mingli Chen 2011的表格找到合適的螺距。接著，在設計好完全阻擋圖區與方向性阻擋圖區的計劃套用先前查表得知的螺距。阻擋圖區的設計仍須考量與靶體積的距離，另外參考Strydhorst 2011提出的建議，需要再繪製虛擬bolus，目的是考量到呼吸造成位移的影響。混和式強度調控治療計劃是利用兩個傳統切線照野射束佔80%處方劑量，再加上兩個強度調控射射束當作輔助射束佔20%處方劑量，處方劑量是50Gy分25次照射。另外，在肺部器官與心臟劑量，將評估在切線對照之照野內射束眼內的照野心臟體積與照野肺部體積。結果：最大照野心臟體積與照野肺部體積分別是15.49 cc和88.8 cc，相較於混和式強度調控治療計劃，優化限制性螺旋刀治療計劃可提高靶體積內的最低劑量（39.16±4.958Gy vs. 30.56±9.478Gy），以及提升均勻度指標（HI=PTVm95%-PTVm107%）（0.9888±0.0054 vs. 0.9690±0.0138），順行度指標（Conformity index, CI）（1.5892±0.2998 vs. 1.6286±0.2526）不分軒輊。另外，優化限制性螺旋刀治療計劃，比起傳統混和式強度調控治療計劃，在心臟的平均劑量是降低了18.38%（2.72±2.214Gy vs. 2.22±1.872Gy）；在左肺部的平均劑量降低了13.74%（5.75±0.848Gy vs. 4.96±1.352Gy）。結論：優化限制性螺旋刀治療技術，在心臟與肺部器官呈現的劑量是較低的，這是因為此技術在計劃過程中有更多可調整的空間。相信螺旋刀治療技術的研究，在左側乳癌放射治療是有幫助的。',\n",
       " 'e': \"Purpose : In order to reduce heart and ipsilateral lung dose, a modified TomoTherapy planning technique for left-sided breast was introduced and compared to Hybrid-IMRT technique. Materials and Methods: A modified TomoTherapy planning technique was designed for left-sided breast cancer patients. It was based on the Limited-TomoTherapy planning technique but applying optimal pitches to achieve better conformity and lower heart and ipsilateral lung dose. First, the optimized off-axis distance was determined. Then the optimal pitches were chosen according to the optimized off-axis distance. The last step was applying optimal pitches with the Limited- TomoTherapy planning technique, which employed several artificial contours such as the Complete-block, Directional-block for near PTV area and the virtual bolus, in the optimized process of the left-sided breast TomoTherpy planning. Hybrid-IMRT plans were designed by tangential-fields and IMRT fields combined. The prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions to PTV. The lung and heart dose volume were measured and analyzed in Beam's-eye-view of tangential-fields with in-field heart volume and in-field lung volume. Result: The maximum volumes of in-field heart volume and in-field lung volume were 15.49 cc and 88.8 cc, respectively. Comparing to the Hybrid-IMRT technique, the modified TomoTherapy planning technique increased the minimal dose of PTV (39.16±4.958 Gy vs. 30.56±9.478 Gy), the homogeneity index (HI= PTV_(m95%)-PTV_(m107%)) was better (0.9888 ± 0.0054 vs. 0.9690 ± 0.0138) and conformity index (CI= V_(95%)/PTV_(95%)) was no obvious difference (1.5892±0.2998 vs. 1.6286±0.2526). The D_(mean) of heart in modified planning technique was under 18.38% than in the Hybrid-IMRT technique (2.22 ± 1.872 Gy vs. 2.72 ± 2.214 Gy). The D_(mean) of Lt lung was under 13.74% in modified planning technique than in the Hybrid-IMRT technique (4.96 ± 1.352 Gy vs. 5.75 ± 0.848 Gy). Discussion and Conclusions: The modified planning technique showed better dose reduction in heart and lung, due to its more flexibility in the optimized planning process. It should be useful in left-sided breast treatment with TomoTherapy.\",\n",

       " 'e_seg_str': \"Purpose : In order to reduce heart and ipsilateral lung dose, a modified TomoTherapy planning technique for left-sided breast was introduced and compared to Hybrid-IMRT technique. Materials and Methods: A modified TomoTherapy planning technique was designed for left-sided breast cancer patients. It was based on the Limited-TomoTherapy planning technique but applying optimal pitches to achieve better conformity and lower heart and ipsilateral lung dose. First, the optimized off-axis distance was determined. Then the optimal pitches were chosen according to the optimized off-axis distance. The last step was applying optimal pitches with the Limited- TomoTherapy planning technique, which employed several artificial contours such as the Complete-block, Directional-block for near PTV area and the virtual bolus, in the optimized process of the left-sided breast TomoTherpy planning. Hybrid-IMRT plans were designed by tangential-fields and IMRT fields combined. The prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions to PTV. The lung and heart dose volume were measured and analyzed in Beam's-eye-view of tangential-fields with in-field heart volume and in-field lung volume. Result: The maximum volumes of in-field heart volume and in-field lung volume were 15.49 cc and 88.8 cc, respectively. Comparing to the Hybrid-IMRT technique, the modified TomoTherapy planning technique increased the minimal dose of PTV (39.16±4.958 Gy vs. 30.56±9.478 Gy), the homogeneity index (HI= PTV_(m95%)-PTV_(m107%)) was better (0.9888 ± 0.0054 vs. 0.9690 ± 0.0138) and conformity index (CI= V_(95%)/PTV_(95%)) was no obvious difference (1.5892±0.2998 vs. 1.6286±0.2526). The D_(mean) of heart in modified planning technique was under 18.38% than in the Hybrid-IMRT technique (2.22 ± 1.872 Gy vs. 2.72 ± 2.214 Gy). The D_(mean) of Lt lung was under 13.74% in modified planning technique than in the Hybrid-IMRT technique (4.96 ± 1.352 Gy vs. 5.75 ± 0.848 Gy). Discussion and Conclusions: The modified planning technique showed better dose reduction in heart and lung, due to its more flexibility in the optimized planning process. It should be useful in left-sided breast treatment with TomoTherapy.\",\n",
